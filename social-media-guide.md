# Social Media Guide

This document is a loose set of policies and guidelines for social media usage
by the OpenTelemetry project. It is not intended to be an exhaustive list of
what and how we should post or market the project, but more a set of principles
and values that we should follow in order to maintain consistency and
professionalism.

## Our Goals

OpenTelemetry's use of social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Mastodon, etc.)
is intended to help us achieve the following goals:

- Increase awareness of the project.
- Highlight the work of contributors and maintainers.
- Help educate and inform users and potential users of the project.

## Our Values

OpenTelemetry is a community-driven project, and as such, our social media usage
should reflect our community standards. Please familiarize yourself with our
[mission, vision, and values](./mission-vision-values.md) as well as our [code
of conduct](./code-of-conduct.md) as the primary reference for how we should
represent ourselves and conduct ourselves on social media.

## Guidelines for Social Media Usage

When creating social content, keep the following general guidelines in mind:

- Be professional and courteous.
  - Avoid hyperbole and exaggeration, or "extremely online" references and
  behavior.
- Do not use OpenTelemetry social accounts to promote a specific proprietary
  product, company, or service.
  - It's OK to refer to a specific product or service in the context of a
    technical discussion, but avoid promoting a specific product or service
    over others.
  - It's also OK to recognize and name individuals employers in the context of
    their contributions to the project.
  - Generally, avoid naming specific companies or products in a way that could
    be construed as an endorsement or an opposition.
  - Never use OpenTelemetry accounts to denigrate, demean, or otherwise make
    negative statements or claims about specific people, companies, products,
    services, or other projects.
- Focus on our overall goals when creating social content.
  - This doesn't mean we can't be fun, or have fun, but we should try to keep
    social content highly relevant.
  - Highlight and celebrate our contributors, releases, achievements, and other
    'sister' projects or initiatives in the CNCF/Open Observability world.
  - Strive to reflect our DEI values in our social content.

An example of content we should strive to regularly post:

- New blog posts, videos, or other content from the project.
- New major releases, especially if accompanied by a blog.
- Ecosystem developments (new exporters, new instrumentation, new tools, etc.)
- New SIGs, WGs, events, or other groups.
- Surveys, polls, or other community engagement activities.
