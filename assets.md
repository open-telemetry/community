## Bot accounts

Related: [Guidelines for adding new GitHub extensions](./docs/using-github-extensions.md).

### Easy CLA

This is not really an OpenTelemetry asset as we do not have any credentials or admin access for it.

For support:
* Check the [EasyCLA status page](https://status.linuxfoundation.org/)
* Open an [OpenTelemetry community issue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/new/choose)
* Ask in the [`#easycla`](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/CK8QVEXQB) Slack channel
* Open an [EasyCLA Jira ticket](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/4/create/143)

### Docker Hub

- We publish images from CI to Docker hub using https://hub.docker.com/u/otelbot account. The bot is registered using cncf-opentelemetry-tc@lists.cncf.io email address and Technical Committee members are owners of this account. The Admin for bot security credentials for CI is @tigrannajaryan

### `otelbot`

This is a [GitHub App] owned by [@open-telemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry) that you can use when
automating common GitHub tasks in OpenTelemetry repos such as release automation tasks.

This GitHub App has the following permissions:

- Read access to metadata
- Read and write access to pull requests

- Admins: [@open-telemetry/admins](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/teams/admins)

This GitHub App addresses two common issues:

1. Since you can't push directly to `main` from workflows (due to branch protections), the next best thing is to
   generate a pull request from the automation and use an account which has signed the CLA as the commit author.

   The OpenTelemetry Bot account has signed the CNCF CLA, and you can assign it as the commit author in your automation:

   ```
   git config user.name otelbot
   git config user.email 197425009+otelbot@users.noreply.github.com
   ```

   It is recommended to push to branch names that start with `otelbot/`, and to add a branch protection
   rule for `otelbot/**/*` with the same setup as documented for
   [`dependabot/**/*`](docs/how-to-configure-new-repository.md#branch-protection-rule-dependabot).

   > [!WARNING]
   > Branch protection rule **ordering** matters, so you will need to delete the `**/**` branch protection rule temporarily, then add the `otelbot/**/*` branch protection rule, then add back the `**/**` branch protection rule.

2. When you use the built-in `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` to generate a pull request from inside a [GitHub Action], workflows
   will not run on that new pull request without closing and re-opening it manually (this limitation is in place to
   prevent accidental recursive workflow runs).

   The OpenTelemetry GitHub organization has a GitHub Action secret (`OTELBOT_PRIVATE_KEY`)
   and a GitHub Action variable `OTELBOT_APP_ID` that can be used to create a GitHub App token
   which will bypass this limitation, e.g.

   ```
   - uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v1
     id: app-token
     with:
       app-id: ${{ vars.OTELBOT_APP_ID }}
       private-key: ${{ secrets.OTELBOT_PRIVATE_KEY }}

   - name: Create pull request
     env:
       # not using secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN since pull requests from that token do not trigger workflows
       GH_TOKEN: ${{ steps.app-token.outputs.token }}
     run: ...
   ```

> [!WARNING]
> The `otelbot` is and needs to remain a **_public_ GitHub App** in order for EasyCLA to be able to verify its CLA status.

[GitHub App]: https://docs.github.com/en/apps

### OpenTelemetry Bot

> [!NOTE]
> Consider using the [otelbot](#otelbot) GitHub App instead.

This is a community-owned bot account that you can use when automating common GitHub tasks
(e.g. release automation tasks).

Important: You do not need to (and should not) give this account any permissions to any OpenTelemetry repository.

Link: [@opentelemetrybot](https://github.com/opentelemetrybot)

- Admins: [@open-telemetry/admins](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/teams/admins
  (GitHub password and associated 2FA for the `@opentelemetrybot` account are available in the GitHub Owners
  1Password)

The OpenTelemetry Bot addresses two common issues:

1. Since you can't push directly to `main` from workflows (due to branch protections), the next best thing is to
   generate a pull request from the automation and use an account which has signed the CLA as the commit author.

   The OpenTelemetry Bot account has signed the CNCF CLA, and you can assign it as the commit author in your automation:

   ```
   git config user.name opentelemetrybot
   git config user.email 107717825+opentelemetrybot@users.noreply.github.com
   ```

   It is recommended to push to branch names that start with `opentelemetrybot/`, and to add a branch protection
   rule for `opentelemetrybot/**/*` with the same setup as documented for
   [`dependabot/**/*`](docs/how-to-configure-new-repository.md#branch-protection-rule-dependabot). Note that branch protection rule ordering matters, so you will need to
   delete the `**/**` branch protection rule temporarily, then add the `opentelemetrybot/**/*` branch protection
   rule, then add back the `**/**` branch protection rule.

2. When you use the built-in `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` to generate a pull request from inside of a GitHub Action, workflows
   will not run on that new pull request without closing and re-opening it manually (this limitation is in place to
   prevent accidental recursive workflow runs).

   The OpenTelemetry GitHub organization has a GitHub Action secret named `OPENTELEMETRYBOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, which is a
   [Personal Access Token][] for [@opentelemetrybot](https://github.com/opentelemetrybot) with `repo`, `workflow` and `read:org`
   scope for the OpenTelemetry Bot that you can use to bypass this limitation.

   The personal access token also has `workflow` scope which is needed when merging upstream changes of
   `.github/workflow` files into opentelemetrybot's forks (these forks are used for automatically opening PRs against
   external repos).

   Maintainers can open an issue in the community repository to have their repository granted access to this
   organization secret.

   [Personal Access Token]: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

### Slack

The slack user [`OpenTelemetry Admin`](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/D07EGBA9V6E) is community owned and can be
used for self-servicing slack (e.g. as Channel Manager to rename spaces).

- Owners: [@open-telemetry/governance-committee](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/teams/governance-committee)
  (To login, go to <https://cloud-native.slack.com/>, click Sign In With Google and login as <admin@opentelemetry.io>.
  Click `Cancel` when you are asked to open slack in the app, and wait for the link `use Slack in your browser` to be
  available and use that.)

## Security

The SIG Security has access to the following tools, with GC and TC members welcome to request access to them as well.
Find more details under [`tools`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/sig-security/tree/main/tools/) on the [SIG Security
GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/sig-security).
