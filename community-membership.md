# Community membership

This doc outlines the various responsibilities of contributor roles in
OpenTelemetry. The OpenTelemetry project is subdivided into subprojects under
(predominantly, but not exclusively) language-focused SIGs (Special Interest
Group). Responsibilities for most roles are scoped to these subprojects (repos).

The OpenTelemetry [Governance Committee][] owns this document and process until
delegated. They can be reached via e-mail cncf-opentelemetry-governance@lists.cncf.io.

### Requirements

- Enabled [two-factor
  authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication)
  on their GitHub account
- Have made multiple contributions to the project or community. Contributions
  may include, but is not limited to:

- Have read the [contributor
  guide](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Actively contributing to 1 or more subprojects.
- Sponsored by 2 approvers. Note the following requirements for sponsors:
  - Sponsors must have close interactions with the prospective member - e.g.
    code/design/proposal review, coordinating on issues, etc.
  - Sponsors must be approvers or maintainers in at least 1 CODEOWNERS file
    in any repo in the OpenTelemetry org.
  - Sponsors must be from multiple member companies to demonstrate integration
    across community.
- [Open an
  issue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/new?template=membership.md&title=REQUEST%3A%20New%20membership%20for%20%3Cyour-GH-handle%3E)
  against the
  [OpenTelemetry/community](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community) repo
  - Ensure your sponsors are `@mentioned` on the issue
  - Complete every item on the checklist ([preview the current version of the
    template](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/membership.md))
  - Make sure that the list of contributions included is representative of your
    work on the project.
- Have your sponsoring reviewers reply confirmation of sponsorship: `I support`
- Once your sponsors have responded, your request will be reviewed by the
  Technical Committee (TC).  Any TC member can review the requirements and add
  Members to the GitHub org.

### Responsibilities and privileges

- Responsive to issues and PRs assigned to them
- Active owner of code they have contributed (unless ownership is explicitly
  transferred)
  - Code is well tested
  - Tests consistently pass
  - Addresses bugs or issues discovered after code is accepted
- Can vote in the [Governance Committee][] elections (see [Members of Standing][])
- Members can review and approve via the GitHub workflow.  This review work is
  not sufficient to merge a PR.  There will still need to be a review by an
  *approver*.
- Members can be assigned to issues and PRs, and people can ask members for
  reviews with a `/cc @username`.

Note: members who frequently contribute code are expected to proactively perform
code reviews and work towards becoming an *approver* for the subproject that
they are active in.  Acceptance of code contributions requires at least one
approver in addition to the reviews by *members.*

## Triager

Triagers assist the maintainers and approvers with project management and
backlog organization. The specific workflows and triage requirements depend on
the project, and are set by the project maintainers.

Defined by: [Triage permissions](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#repository-access-for-each-permission-level),
with the names of the current Triagers commited to git, either in CONTRIBUTING,
CODEOWNERS, or the bottom of the README.

Triagers may be code contributors, but writing code is not a requirement for
becoming a triager. Triagers are encouraged to be active participants in project
meetings, chat rooms, and other discussion forums.

### Requirements

- Nominated by a maintainer, with no objections from other maintainers.
- Consistently interact with the community and help with issues for at least 1 month.

### Responsibilities and privileges

- Have an understanding of the goals and workflows defined by the maintainers.
- Respond to new PRs and Issues by asking clarifying questions.
- Organize the backlog by applying labels, milestones, assignees, and projects.

## Approver

Code approvers are able to both review and approve code contributions, as well
as help maintainers triage issues and do project management.

While code review is focused on code quality and correctness, approval is
focused on holistic acceptance of a contribution including: backwards/forwards
compatibility, adhering to API and flag conventions, subtle performance and
correctness issues, interactions with other parts of the system, etc.

Defined by: [CODEOWNERS
workflow](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-code-owners).

Approver status can be scoped to a part of the codebase. For example, critical
core components may have higher bar for becoming an approver.

### Requirements

The following apply to the part of the codebase for which one would be an
approver in the `CODEOWNERS` files.

- Reviewer of the codebase for at least 1 month
- Reviewer for or author of at least 10 substantial PRs to the codebase,
  with the definition of substantial subject to the maintainer's discretion
  (e.g. refactors/adds new functionality rather than one-line pulls).
- Nominated by a maintainer
  - With no objections from other maintainers
  - Done through PR to update the `CODEOWNERS`.

### Responsibilities and privileges

The following apply to the part of the codebase for which one would be an
approver in the `CODEOWNERS` files.

- Approver status may be a precondition to accepting large code contributions
- Demonstrate sound technical judgement (may be asked to step down by a maintainer if they lose confidence of the maintainers)
- Responsible for project quality control via code reviews
  - Focus on holistic acceptance of contribution such as dependencies with other
    features, backwards / forwards compatibility, API and flag definitions, etc
- Expected to be responsive to review requests (inactivity for more than 1 month may result in suspension until active again)
- Mentor contributors and reviewers
- May approve code contributions for acceptance

## Maintainer

Note: This is a generalized high-level description of the role, and the
specifics of the maintainer role's responsibilities and related processes *MUST*
be defined for individual SIGs or subprojects.

Maintainers are the technical authority for a subproject in the OpenTelemetry
project. They *MUST* have demonstrated both good judgement and responsibility
towards the health of that subproject. Maintainers *MUST* set technical
direction and make or approve design decisions for their subproject - either
directly or through delegation of these responsibilities.

Defined by: GitHub organization ownership, permissions and entry in `CODEOWNERS`
files.

### Requirements

Unlike the roles outlined above, the maintainers of a subproject are typically
limited to a relatively small group of decision makers and updated as fits
the needs of the subproject.

The following apply to the subproject for which one would be a maintainer.

- Deep understanding of the technical goals and direction of the subproject
- Deep understanding of the technical domain (specifically the language) of the
  subproject
- Sustained contributions to design and direction by doing all of:
  - Authoring and reviewing proposals
  - Initiating, contributing and resolving discussions (emails, GitHub issues,
    meetings)
  - Identifying subtle or complex issues in designs and implementation PRs
- Directly contributed to the subproject through implementation and / or review
- Aligning with the overall project goals, specifications and design principles
  defined by Technical Committee (TC). Bringing general questions and requests
  to the discussions as part of specifications project.
- Scheduling SIG meetings using the [OpenTelemetry Public
  Calendar](./docs/how-to-handle-public-calendar.md).

### Responsibilities and privileges

The following apply to the subproject for which one would be a maintainer.

- Make and approve technical design decisions for the subproject.
- Set technical direction and priorities for the subproject.
- Define milestones and releases.
  - Decides on when PRs are merged to control the release scope.
- Mentor and guide approvers, reviewers, and contributors to the subproject.
- Escalate *reviewer* and *maintainer* workflow concerns (i.e. responsiveness,
  availability, and general contributor community health) to the TC.
- Ensure continued health of subproject:
  - Adequate test coverage to confidently release
  - Tests are passing reliably (i.e. not flaky) and are fixed when they fail
- Ensure a healthy process for discussion and decision making is in place.
- Work with other maintainers to maintain the project's overall health and
  success holistically.

### Becoming a Maintainer

Unless stated otherwise in a SIG charter ratified by the Technical Committee,
a new maintainer is elected by vote of the existing maintainers of the SIG.
The vote is officially started when a pull request to add a new maintainer
is opened, and ends when the pull request is merged. The pull request may be
merged when the following conditions are met:

- The person being nominated has accepted the nomination by approving the pull request
- All maintainers have approved the pull request OR a majority of maintainers
  have approved the pull request and no maintainer has objected by requesting
  changes on the pull request. In the case that all maintainers have not given
  approval, the pull request should stay open for a minimum of 5 days before merging.

The nominee is considered a maintainer after the pull request is merged.

#### Self-nomination is encouraged

If you feel like you meet the requirements above and are willing to take on the
additional responsibilities and privileges of being a maintainer, it is
recommended that you approach an existing maintainer about sponsoring your bid
to become a maintainer. After you and your sponsor have discussed the role
and its additional requirements and responsibilities, they may approach the other
maintainers about a vote to confirm you as a new maintainer. If the maintainer
does not believe you are ready for the role, or the subproject is not in need
of additional maintainers, they may suggest an alternate role or growth areas
in order to improve your chances to become a maintainer in the future.

### Resolving technical conflicts within a SIG

From time to time, the Maintainers for a given OpenTelemetry SIG may be unable
to reach consensus on a technical issue. While it's healthy and appropriate to
make a sincere attempt to understand all points of view and consider the
tradeoffs, it's also healthy to occasionally "disagree and commit."

Within OpenTelemetry, SIG Maintainers are chosen specifically _because_ they
are domain experts, so we would like to keep as much of the decision-making
authority with the SIG Maintainers rather than immediately "escalating" to the
overall OpenTelemetry-wide Technical Committee. As such, this is
OpenTelemetry's process for resolving technical issues where Maintainers cannot
reach consensus:

1. The SIG Maintainers should succintly document the options under
consideration as a GitHub issue within the SIG's respective repo (note that it
is *not* required to document the complete framing and pros/cons – just the
actual go-forward options themselves).
2. Each SIG Maintainer must formally vote for their choice by commenting on
that issue.
3. The option receiving the most votes wins.
4. If the vote is a tie, the OpenTelemetry TC should be brought into the
discussion, and the TC itself gets a (single) tiebreaking vote.

While inevitably these sorts of decisions will be disappointing for somebody,
it's incredibly important for the project to maintain velocity and recognize
that we are all coming to these sorts of technical issues with the best of
intentions and remain aligned about the overall goals of the OpenTelemetry
project.

## Emeritus Maintainer/Approver/Triager

For any healthy open source project, it is inevitable that contributors may move
on, step down, or otherwise reduce their role in the project for some period of
time. These people may have expertise in one or more area of the project, but no
longer have time to actively contribute or approve contributions. They are
encouraged to reflect this by adding themselves to the `emeritus` section of the
CONTRIBUTING, CODEOWNERS, or README of the subproject they are stepping away
from. GitHub usernames listed under the `emeritus` section should be removed
from the approvers list, and will no longer have any official responsibilities
with the project. When a contributor returns to being more active, they may be
promoted back to a their previous position at the discretion of the current
maintainers following the process defined above.
