# Resolving Technical Conflicts Within a SIG

From time to time, the Maintainers for a given OpenTelemetry SIG may be unable
to reach consensus on a technical issue. While it's healthy and appropriate to
make a sincere attempt to understand all points of view and consider the
tradeoffs, it's also healthy to occasionally "disagree and commit."

Within OpenTelemetry, SIG Maintainers are chosen specifically *because* they
are domain experts, so we would like to keep as much of the decision-making
authority with the SIG Maintainers rather than immediately "escalating" to the
overall OpenTelemetry-wide Technical Committee (TC). As such, this is
OpenTelemetry's process for resolving technical issues where Maintainers cannot
reach consensus:

1. The SIG Maintainers should succinctly document the options under
consideration as a GitHub issue within the SIG's respective repo (note that it
is *not* required to document the complete framing and pros/cons – just the
actual go-forward options themselves).
2. Each SIG Maintainer must formally vote for their choice by commenting on
that issue.
3. The option receiving the most votes wins.
4. If the vote is a tie, the OpenTelemetry TC should be brought into the
discussion, and the TC itself gets a (single) tiebreaking vote.

While inevitably these sorts of decisions will be disappointing for somebody,
it's incredibly important for the project to maintain velocity and recognize
that we are all coming to these sorts of technical issues with the best of
intentions and remain aligned about the overall goals of the OpenTelemetry
project.
