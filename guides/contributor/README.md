## What is OpenTelemetry?

OpenTelemetry is a framework for application telemetry data. If you've ever
checked how much memory a process is using on your computer, or looked at the
size of a file, you've already interacted with telemetry! Cloud native systems
create, emit, and process many millions of telemetry points every second as they
run. In addition, the developers of cloud native software need to describe what
their applications are doing in production in order to find bugs, optimize their
system performance, and understand their applications. OpenTelemetry provides a
single standard for creating and collecting this telemetry, transforming it as
needed, and exporting it to dozens of analysis tools.

## Prerequisites

Before you submit code to OpenTelemetry, you'll need to have a few things set
