# OpenTelemetry Guidebooks

This directory contains a collection of guides meant for contributors,
maintainers, and community members. These guides are meant to help you get
started, answer common questions, and provide best practices for being a part of
the OpenTelemetry community. These should be considered a living resource, and
everyone is welcome to contribute to them!
