## What is the End User Working Group? 

There are two primary goals of the End User Working Group: 
* Foster a sense of vendor-agnostic community for OpenTelemetry end-users to promote learning and adoption. We currently accomplish this through:   Organization and facilitation of End User Discussion Group & Administration of a private end-user discussion slack channel.
* Facilitate the collection and communication of end-user feedback to OpenTelemetry project special interest groups to influence SIG priorities. We currently accomplish this through: Creation and maintenance of end-user research assets such as OpenTelemetry Community surveys & Organization and facilitation of structured end-user interview sessions.

Our group discourages promotion of vendor-specific solutions and desires to keep the focus on OpenTelemetry core technologies, adoption and usage.

## Get Involved

There are many ways to get involved in our work! We (End User Working Group) meet every two weeks on Thursdays at 10:00 AM PST. Check out the [OpenTelemetry community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=google.com_b79e3e90j7bbsa2n2p5an5lf60%40group.calendar.google.com)
