# <img src="https://opentelemetry.io/img/logos/opentelemetry-logo-nav.png" alt="OpenTelemetry Icon" width="45" height=""> OpenTelemetry community surveys
This document is intended to outline best practices for long running and durable OpenTelemetry community surveys. 

The OpenTelemetry community would like to gather data about end-users including their experiences, preferences, perceptions and opinions about OpenTelemetry. This data can be used to inform priorities within various OpenTelemetry projects. 

# Active Surveys: 
1: [OpenTelemetry Quarterly Feedback Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKm6oLYRXlZOhEZMVmjoIn4eBToVYNmF6fwpm5GAIipQmPxA/viewform?pli=1)
   
- Intent: Gather quantitative data on our end-user community through a simple periodic survey that provides insight with established long running Key Results that we can trend over time. Recruit end-users for future qualitative studies and surveys
- Survey owners: @sharrmander and @henrikrexed
- Duration: This survey will be available in perpetuity with some intentional advertising/pushing once a quarter to submit feedback. 
- Distribution: Survey Results will be summarized on a quarterly basis

# Community survey best practices

### Community survey principles
- User feedback should be a mix of qualitative and quantitative:
  - Qualitative to validate/invalidate hypotheses
  - Quantitative to set a baseline for key results and segment customers
- All user feedback will be collected anonymously except direct customer interviews
- Raw data should be transparent to the community/world
- The end user working group will reach consensus on key milestones, including:
  - Recurring/perpetual survey design
  - Survey Hypotheses
  - Measuring Key Results
  - Survey Best Practices
  - Summarizing and reporting results

### Recognized Survey Types: 
1. Direct Survey (anonymous)
    - OpenTelemetry end user submits survey form

2. Vendor-mediated Customer Interview (semi-anonymous)
    - Vendor interviews customer & then submits survey form on end-user’s behalf

### Survey reminders: 
- Be respectful of the survey-takers' time, in general try to keep the survey short in duration, with specific and targeted questions. You can always ask if you can follow up with them to get deeper context.
- We want to measure improvements too, so using trendable questions helps us assess how we’re doing 
- We encourage mix of general and targeted surveys

### Helpful questions and considerations: 

- Audience identification: 
   - Who will participate in the survey? What is their user role?
  - Do you need any segmentation or demographic information to meet your survey goals?
  - How many participants do you need for success? 
- Establish Survey Intent & Goals:
  - What are you looking to learn/identify/measure?
  - How will the data be used?
  - What are the survey Key Results?
- Crafting Survey Questions: 
  - What is the problem/feedback you want to gather data on?
  - Should you be looking for quantitative or qualitative information, or both?
- Distribution Channels: 
  - Where will the survey be advertised?
  - How will end-users be invited to participate? 
- How do you plan to analyze & distribute the survey responses: 
  - How will the data be reported? 
  - What can be summarized? 
  - Do you have any conclusions, insights or recommendations?
