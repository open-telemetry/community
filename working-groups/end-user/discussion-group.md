## What this discussion group is: 
Members of the OpenTelemetry End User working group facilitate monthly discussion groups to bring together operations and development engineers from different organizations to discuss challenges and solutions to achieving ubiquitous observability. This vendor neutral event provides space for end users to share successes and failures, discover best practices, and meet others who are also on a journey to implement observability powered by OpenTelemetry.


This group is what its participants make it--whatever is of interest to the group is fair game! But here are some of the kinds of topics we expect will be on the table:
- Refactoring with telemetry
- What is company X doing with OpenTelemetry?
- Correlating multiple observability signals
- Maintaining and scaling OpenTelemetry deployments
- Writing custom instrumentation

### What this discussion group is not: 

The OpenTelemetry community is constantly evolving and is composed of vendors, adopting organizations and independent contributors. There may be vendor spectators in the audience, however this group is not an event where collecting leads will be tolerated because that’s a direct violation of Chatham House Rule.

## How to participate:
These discussion groups occur on a monthly basis in AMER and EMEA friendly timezones, and creation of an APAC friendly timezone group is in the planning stages. You can see these events on the [community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=google.com_b79e3e90j7bbsa2n2p5an5lf60%40group.calendar.google.com) by searching for “discussion group.”  

## What to expect:
The format of the discussion groups should evolve over time to provide the best experience for participants. In the meantime, the format of the discussion groups is [Lean Coffee style](https://leancoffee.org/), where discussion topics are generated and democratically selected by the group at the start of the meeting. Then topics are rigorously time-boxed by a facilitator to keep the discussion moving forward.

Because it can be a bit intimidating to talk to strangers, especially when talking about challenges, discussion groups are held under [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule). This means you are free to use the information or stories you learned in the discussion group but you CAN NOT share the identity of any participants or the company they are associated with. Discussion groups are not recorded.



## FAQ: 

Q: Is this group only for OpenTelemetry end users?

A: No! Anyone is welcome to join and discuss their journey to observability. This group is hosted by the OpenTelemetry Community End-User Working Group, so we expect most participants will be from organizations that are evaluating or using OpenTelemetry.

Q: I have questions about this, who can I reach out to?

A: You can find members and discussion group facilitators in the End User Working Group in CNCF slack channel [#otel-user-research](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01RT3MSWGZ).
