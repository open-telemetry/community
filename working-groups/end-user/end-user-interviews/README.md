## What are end user interviews? 

- The OpenTelemetry community conducts end user interviews to gather high fidelity information from users though the medium of synchronous discussions to learn about their challenges, preferences, and behaviors regarding OpenTelemetry. 

## Why do these interviews happen? 

- Many vendors in this space conduct interviews with their customers but that feedback doesn't always make its way back to the community directly. These interviews will help us test our assumptions, categorize end-users, and describe their needs so that the community can react to their feedback. 

## When do these sessions happen? 
- Our end user working group goal is to hold at least one session a month. 
- Our scheduling preference is for these sessions to occur at 10:00 AM PST on Thursdays, however the final schedule will be dictated by the end-user interviewee’s availability.

## Are the interview sessions recorded? 
- Sessions are only recorded if the end user is comfortable with them being recorded. In this directory, you can find links to both video recordings and session summaries created by the Facilitator and Helper roles, as appropriate. 

## What are the end user interview roles?

* ### Interview Facilitator: - Required
  -  The interview facilitator is a named role for each session and is responsible for the end-to-end control of the interview.  The facilitator identifies end-users, confirms their availability and schedules the interview. The facilitator can ask questions themselves and lead the interview, or they can delegate the flow of the discussion to another named person. If there is a known agenda/area of feedback the facilitator communicates this to the end-user to prepare them for a successful session. The facilitator follows up post-interview with a note of appreciation for the end-users participation. 

* ### End-user Interviewee: - Required
  - The end-user interviewee communicates their preference on scheduling and session duration. The end-user attends and shares feedback and stories about their experience with OpenTelemetry. 
  - Interviewee selection criteria vary and change depending on the needs of the community. Some example criteria includes “people who have used OTel before”, “people who have implemented monitoring, telemetry, observability either in code or in platforms”, “people who develop software and don’t feel they have enough information about how it works in environments other than their laptop”

* ### OTel Community Helper: - Required
  - The OTel community helper is a named role for each session. The community helper will complete coordination and amplification tasks such as tracking session recording links, acting as note keeper, and publishing up an interview summary. The community helper can also be the same person as the interview facilitator. 

* ### OTel Community member audience: - Optional
  - Members from the OTel community are welcome to observe the interview and coordinate with the facilitator if there are any specific topics they’d like to be included during the interview. 

## How can I get involved or learn more?
- Are you interested in providing the community your feedback in this way? Please contact us in [#otel-user-research](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01RT3MSWGZ) on CNCF Slack to talk about scheduling. And as always, you can provide your feedback to the community in many ways including our community surveys too. 
- Are you someone who is passionate about gathering and sharing end user feedback? Would you like to help us conduct interviews, improve how we solicit feedback or design a more robust end user interview program? If so, we'd love to hear from you too! We are a friendly, collaborative group and look forward to working together!
