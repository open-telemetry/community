Suggested Interview Flow (30/60 minute duration)

## Housekeeping (~5 min)

- [ ] Confirm it’s ok to record the interview. [Start Recording if not auto-enabled]
- [ ] Outline the expected flow for the interview, highlighting any special topics and that there will be time for the audience and the end-user to ask questions too.
- [ ] Introduce yourself and ask them to introduce themselves (and the audience too if time allows)
 
## Warm-up questions (~3 / 10 min)

- Can you describe your architecture, programming languages that your organization uses, and deployment environment? How do you deploy applications today?
- How are the apps/services that you work with currently instrumented and/or logged?
- What telemetry are you capturing, and where are you sending it?
- How do you interact with telemetry coming from apps/services in your org? If not, who?
- Are you using vendor-specific telemetry instrumentation? If so, why?

## Meaty questions (~15 / 25 min) 
This section will depend upon goals for the interview and what assumptions and/or hypothesis is being tested, some suggested questions are below:
- What [would] prevents you from implementing [better] telemetry?
- Who else is also involved in improving your telemetry landscape?
- Are you interested in contributing to this project/community, if so what challenges do you have with that?

## Turn the tables (~5 / 10 min)
