We use a Lean Coffee format to help facilitate effective community discussions. This style is great for lightly structured groups because participants have full influence over the topics they most want to engage with and through the use of timeboxing, it helps ensure that no one person or one topic dominates the discussion.

If you haven’t heard of lean coffee, this is a nice high level introduction: https://leancoffee.org/

To help with facilitation structure, the best practice is to use a tool for topic generation and voting. One of the best tools I’ve encountered for this use case is [agile.coffee](http://agile.coffee/). You can make a board each session or you can re-use the same board from prior discussion groups (if you choose to reuse, don’t forget to delete the prior topic cards!). I suggest configuring the board to allow for 3 or 4 votes per person (general guidance is the larger the group, the more votes to allocate per person). Screen sharing the facilitation tool helps late arrivals acclimate to the group and participate more quickly. 

### As facilitator of a discussion group, your role is to: 

#### 1. Verbally set the stage, welcome the group and reiterate the following points:
- Group discussions are held under [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule). Briefly explain that Chatham House Rule is “You are free to use the information or stories you learn today in the discussion group but you CAN NOT share the identity of any participants or the company they are associated with.”
- Communicate that the discussion group will not be recorded
- If there are vendor spectators in the audience, set expectations that this is not a lead generation event and if that’s their intention they need to drop off the call. Remind everyone that lead generation is a direct violation of Chatham House Rule. 
- Give a ~90 second introduction to lean coffee for new attendees. 
  - Review what action you need from participants (proposing topics and voting on topics). 
  - Remind folks that the agile.coffee board contents could be discoverable and not to add information they or their employer might consider sensitive.
#### 2. Prepare the topic backlog: 
- In chat, send a link to the agile.coffee board and ask people to add in topics they would like to discuss.
- Timebox topic generation to about 2-3 minutes, allowing for more time in the event there are still multiple new proposed topics coming in.
- After topics are all submitted, de-duplicate, or merge as appropriate. In agile.coffee you can drag and drop topic cards to merge. 
- Ask people to vote on topics they’d most like to discuss. Set aside about 60 seconds for voting. Remind the audience they can spend all their votes on one topic, or they can spread their votes out among multiple topics. Agile.coffee should automatically stack rank topics according to vote count.
#### 3. Kick off the discussion, keep time and burn down the topic backlog: 
- Remind folks you’re putting 4-5 minutes of time on the clock and in agile.coffee, pull the most voted on topic card into the “currently discussing” column. 
- Ask whoever wrote the current topic to kick off the discussion, perhaps by providing more context or elaborating on the topic item. 
- When the countdown expires, let the current speaker wrap up their line of thinking or cut them off gently. 
- Solicit a vote to continue discussing the current topic or move to the next topic. Use your best judgment. If the vote is to continue with the current topic, add 2-3 minutes to the timer and repeat steps c & d until the vote is to move onto the next topic. 
- Don’t forget to move the topic through the “currently discussing” and into the “done discussing” column. Then repeat step 3 until all topics have been discussed or not enough time remains to start a new topic. 
#### 4. Close the discussion group: 
- Show appreciation for participation and engagement. 
- Ask the participants to provide feedback on the discussion group in the chat window before they log off. Good questions include: 
--Would they recommend this group to a friend or colleague?
--What is one thing they’d like to see changed for the next discussion group.
#### 5. Report back to the community: 
- After the discussion group concludes, please report back to [#otel-user-research](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01RT3MSWGZ) and share the topics discussed, the number of attendees, the rough number of active participants and any feedback you received. The end user working group appreciates visibility into current interests of end users.
