## Get Involved

There is a lot to do! If you are interested in getting involved, please join
the mailing lists and attend the community meetings. If you're interested in
contributing to a specific part of the project, please join the appropriate
special interest group (SIG). Details for all of these items are below. We are
a friendly, collaborative group and look forward to working together!

## Governing Bodies

* Governance Committee (GC): [Charter](./governance-charter.md), [Members](./community-members.md#governance-committee)
* Technical Committee (TC): [Charter](./tech-committee-charter.md), [Members](./community-members.md#technical-committee)

Both committees meet regularly, and the respective meeting notes are publicly available in the [GC meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-23Sf7-xZK3OL5Ogv2pK0NP9YotlSa0PKU9bvvtQwp8) and the [TC meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hOHPCu5TGenqTeWPB9qQB_qd33uITZBcvK1FnWxYJAw) Google Docs. The Governance Committee meetings are also recorded.
If you want to check out the recordings, head to the [meeting recordings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SYKfjYhZdm2Wh2Cl6KVQalKg_m4NhTPZqq-8SzEVO6s).

## Areas of Interest

Technical committee members, maintainers, and approvers are encouraged
to list their [areas of interest in this
document](areas-of-interest.md) to help community members find
interested parties and form new special interest groups.

## Communication

### Discussions

We use [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/discussions) for most communications. Please join us there!

For those who are brand new to OpenTelemetry and want to chat or get redirected to the appropriate place for a specific question, feel free to join [the CNCF OpenTelemetry Slack channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/CJFCJHG4Q). If you are new, you can create a CNCF Slack account [here](https://slack.cncf.io/).

### Calendar

The shared community calendar contains all public OpenTelemetry meetings,
including weekly SIG meetings, monthly community meetings, etc. You
can access it via:

* [Web](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_2bf73e3b6b530da4babd444e72b76a6ad893a5c3f43cf40467abc7a9a897f977%40group.calendar.google.com)
* [Google
Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=c_2bf73e3b6b530da4babd444e72b76a6ad893a5c3f43cf40467abc7a9a897f977@group.calendar.google.com)
* [iCalendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/c_2bf73e3b6b530da4babd444e72b76a6ad893a5c3f43cf40467abc7a9a897f977%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)

The best way to subscribe to specific OpenTelemetry meeting series is to join the associated
[calendar-...@opentelemetry.io meeting invite groups below](#special-interest-groups).
This will invite you to the specific OpenTelemetry meetings, correctly block time for
accepted meetings, and keep your calendar in sync with new and updated events.

Alternatively, if you wish to subscribe to all OpenTelemetry meeting series you can subscribe to [calendar-all@opentelemetry.io](https://groups.google.com/a/opentelemetry.io/g/calendar-all).

## License

All OpenTelemetry projects are shipped under the permissive Apache 2.0 license
as CNCF IP Policy
[dictates](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/charter.md#11-ip-policy).
This [blog post](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2017/02/01/cncf-recommends-aslv2/)
explains the reasoning behind choosing this license.
Refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-attribution)
for details on code attribution.

## Logos and Brand Guide

The OpenTelemetry logos and brand guide can be found in the [CNCF artwork
repository](https://github.com/cncf/artwork/tree/master/projects/opentelemetry). In addition, a [Google Slides template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Neab3OZ3c-m5kOE37iZXEVpK4Pjj6xGTJEUuUzLQJvk/edit?usp=sharing) is also available.

## How to

- [Get access and manage meetings](docs/how-to-handle-public-calendar.md).
- [Request GitHub extension or create a bit](docs/using-github-extensions.md).
- [Configure new repository](docs/how-to-configure-new-repository.md): listing settings TC members set when creating the new repository.

## Special Interest Groups

We organize the community into Special Interest Groups (SIGs) to
improve our workflow and more efficiently manage a community project. While meetings are expected to happen regularly, they are subject to contributors' availability and may be rescheduled or changed at time. Check our [public calendar](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#calendar) and SIG-specific GitHub discussions for meeting changes and cancellations. All meetings happen over Zoom, have a meeting notes document, and are recorded and [available on Zoom cloud](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SYKfjYhZdm2Wh2Cl6KVQalKg_m4NhTPZqq-8SzEVO6s).

Please do not hesitate to contact SIG owners if the proposed time of the
meeting or tools used is unavailable for you. For instance, it is a good
practice to alternate morning/evening meetings once SIG has representatives
from 3 largely distinct timezones. The best way to report it and suggest an
alternative is to file an issue on this repository or discuss it in
SIG-specific GitHub discussions.
