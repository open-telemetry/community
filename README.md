### License

All OpenTelemetry projects are shipped under the permissive Apache 2.0 license as CNCF IP Policy [dictates](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/charter.md#11-ip-policy). This [blog post](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2017/02/01/cncf-recommends-aslv2/) explains the reasoning behind choosing this license.

## Community Meetings

We host monthly community video conferences, alternating between times that work for Europe and Asia. These meetings are open to all contributors!

Meeting invites can be accessed from our public Calendar ([web](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=google.com_b79e3e90j7bbsa2n2p5an5lf60%40group.calendar.google.com), [gCal](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Z29vZ2xlLmNvbV9iNzllM2U5MGo3YmJzYTJuMnA1YW41bGY2MEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t), [iCal](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/google.com_b79e3e90j7bbsa2n2p5an5lf60%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)), and we keep public notes in the agenda document available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uvua6R-VnOpMmAjM3b7j3jQDFz6KHDzbEX4ZaZ9BFso).

## Special Interest Groups

We organize the community into Special Interest Groups (SIGs) in order to improve our workflow and more easily manage a community project.

Please do not hesitate to contact SIG owners if the proposed time of the meeting
or tools used are unavailable for you. For instance, it will be a good practice
to alternate morning/evening meetings once SIG has representatives from 3
largely distinct timezones. The best way to report it and suggest an alternative
is to file an issue on this repository or discuss it in SIG-specific gitter
channel.

### Cross-language specification

This is a group for people interested in writing cross-language specifications
and participate in high-level design discussions. SIG will be led by the members
of a Technical Committee
[@open-telemetry/technical-committee](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/teams/technical-committee).
It is recommended for all members of
[@open-telemetry/specs-approvers](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/teams/specs-approvers)
and open for all.
