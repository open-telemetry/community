### License

All OpenTelemetry projects are shipped under the permissive Apache 2.0 license
as CNCF IP Policy
[dictates](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/charter.md#11-ip-policy).
This [blog post](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2017/02/01/cncf-recommends-aslv2/)
explains the reasoning behind choosing this license.

### Logos and Brand Guide

The OpenTelemetry logos and brand guide can be found in the [CNCF artwork
repository](https://github.com/cncf/artwork/tree/master/projects/opentelemetry).

## Community Meetings

We host monthly community video conferences, alternating between times that
work for Europe and Asia. These meetings are open to all contributors!

Meeting invites can be accessed from our [public Calendar](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#calendar). We keep public notes in the agenda document available
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uvua6R-VnOpMmAjM3b7j3jQDFz6KHDzbEX4ZaZ9BFso).

## Special Interest Groups

We organize the community into Special Interest Groups (SIGs) in order to
improve our workflow and more easily manage a community project. While meetings are expected to happen regularly, they are subject to contributors' availability and may be rescheduled or changed at time. Check our [public calendar](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#calendar) and SIG-specific Gitter channel for meeting changes and cancellations. All meetings happen over Zoom, are recorded and [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHZDBZTIfdy94xMjMKz-_MA/videos), and have a meeting notes document.

Please do not hesitate to contact SIG owners if the proposed time of the
meeting or tools used are unavailable for you. For instance, it is a good
practice to alternate morning/evening meetings once SIG has representatives
from 3 largely distinct timezones. The best way to report it and suggest an
alternative is to file an issue on this repository or discuss it in
SIG-specific Gitter channel.
