## Get Involved

There is a lot to do! If you are interested in getting involved, please join
the mailing lists and attend the community meetings. If you're interested in
contributing to a specific part of the project, please join the appropriate
special interest group (SIG). Details for all of these items are below. We are
a friendly, collaborative group and look forward to working together!

## Governing Bodies

* Governance Committee (GC): [Charter](./governance-charter.md), [Members](./community-members.md#governance-committee)
* Technical Committee (TC): [Charter](./tech-committee-charter.md), [Members](./community-members.md#technical-committee)

Both committees meet regularly, and the respective meeting notes are publicly available in the [GC meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-23Sf7-xZK3OL5Ogv2pK0NP9YotlSa0PKU9bvvtQwp8) and the [TC meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hOHPCu5TGenqTeWPB9qQB_qd33uITZBcvK1FnWxYJAw) Google Docs. The Governance Committee meetings are also recorded.
If you want to check out the recordings, head to the [meeting recordings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SYKfjYhZdm2Wh2Cl6KVQalKg_m4NhTPZqq-8SzEVO6s).

## Areas of Interest

Technical committee members, maintainers, and approvers are encouraged
to list their [areas of interest in this
document](areas-of-interest.md) to help community members find
interested parties and form new special interest groups.

## Communication

### Discussions

We use [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/discussions) for most communications. Please join us there!

For those who are brand new to OpenTelemetry and want to chat or get redirected to the appropriate place for a specific question, feel free to join [the CNCF OpenTelemetry Slack channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/CJFCJHG4Q). If you are new, you can create a CNCF Slack account [here](https://slack.cncf.io/).

### Calendar

The shared community calendar contains all public OpenTelemetry meetings,
including weekly SIG meetings, monthly community meetings, etc. You
can access it via:

* [Web](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=google.com_b79e3e90j7bbsa2n2p5an5lf60%40group.calendar.google.com)
* [Google
Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Z29vZ2xlLmNvbV9iNzllM2U5MGo3YmJzYTJuMnA1YW41bGY2MEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)
* [iCalendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/google.com_b79e3e90j7bbsa2n2p5an5lf60%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)
(syncs with Outlook)

The best way to subscribe to OpenTelemetry events is to join the [calendar updates Google
Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opentelemetry-calendar). This will invite you to every OpenTelemetry call and correctly block time for
accepted events, and it will keep your calendar in sync with new and updated events.

(Internal Note: When creating or updating a calendar event in the `OpenTelemetry Public Calendar`, please ensure that `opentelemetry-calendar@googlegroups.com`
is added as an attendee to the meeting invite.  This is what allows updates to the calendar to be synchronized to other attendees.)

## License

All OpenTelemetry projects are shipped under the permissive Apache 2.0 license
as CNCF IP Policy
[dictates](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/charter.md#11-ip-policy).
This [blog post](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2017/02/01/cncf-recommends-aslv2/)

## Logos and Brand Guide

The OpenTelemetry logos and brand guide can be found in the [CNCF artwork
repository](https://github.com/cncf/artwork/tree/master/projects/opentelemetry). In addition, a [Google Slides template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Neab3OZ3c-m5kOE37iZXEVpK4Pjj6xGTJEUuUzLQJvk/edit?usp=sharing) is also available.

## How to

- [Get access and manage meetings](docs/how-to-handle-public-calendar.md).
- [Request GitHub extension or create a bit](docs/using-github-extensions.md).
- [Configure new repository](docs/how-to-configure-new-repository.md): listing settings TC members set when creating the new repository.

## Special Interest Groups

We organize the community into Special Interest Groups (SIGs) to
improve our workflow and more efficiently manage a community project. While meetings are expected to happen regularly, they are subject to contributors' availability and may be rescheduled or changed at time. Check our [public calendar](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#calendar) and SIG-specific GitHub discussions for meeting changes and cancellations. All meetings happen over Zoom, have a meeting notes document, and are recorded and [available on Zoom cloud](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SYKfjYhZdm2Wh2Cl6KVQalKg_m4NhTPZqq-8SzEVO6s).

Please do not hesitate to contact SIG owners if the proposed time of the
meeting or tools used is unavailable for you. For instance, it is a good
practice to alternate morning/evening meetings once SIG has representatives
from 3 largely distinct timezones. The best way to report it and suggest an
alternative is to file an issue on this repository or discuss it in
SIG-specific GitHub discussions.
