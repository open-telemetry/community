# OpenTelemetry is a complex project with many moving parts. Thankfully, we
# strive to keep those parts loosely coupled where we can (this has been a goal
# since the very announcement of OpenTelemetry, per this blog post:
# https://medium.com/opentracing/merging-opentracing-and-opencensus-f0fe9c7ca6f0)
#
# This file describes the structure of the project and its sub-components,
# definitions of API and stability maturity levels, and finally records the
# current maturity of each component. We maintain this file as YAML in order to
# make it easier to automate scripts (e.g., for the website) that present the
# data to OpenTelemetry end-users.


###############################################################################
# MATURITY LEVELS
#
# OpenTelemetry components advertise their own maturity along two axes:
# - PRODUCTION MATURITY: How reliable is this component from a
#   production-readiness standpoint?
# - API MATURITY: How stable is the component's API from a backwards- and
#   forwards-compatibility standpoint)?
#
# In some cases, for instance, OpenTelemetry components may be immature from an
# API maturity standpoint, yet be nearly 100% safe from a production standpoint
# – and vice versa. Similarly, end-users may have more tolerance for lost
# development time or software stability depending on their situation, so we
# strive to separate self-reported maturity along these two axes.
#
# Needless to say, representations here are best-effort, and there is no
# substitute for a mature release process. I.e., don't blindly deploy "mature"
# OpenTelemetry components (or any software, for that matter!).
productionMaturityLevels:
  # "unknown" maturity is just what it purports to be. It's reasonable to
  # assume "unstable", but we separate "unknown" and "unstable" to distinguish
  # between a lack of evidence about production maturity and actual evidence of
  # immaturity.
  - unknown

  # "unstable" components are not recommended for production workloads. They
  # may crash the process, introduce performance artifacts, or have known
  # security issues.
  - unstable

  # "beta" components have been used successfully in production workloads at
  # scale: that is, the component is used in support of well-known product
  # functionality at publicly-held companies. Nevertheless, either due to
  # the uncertainty introduced by active development or a small number of
  # production environments, they should still be used cautiously in new
  # deployments. They do not have known security issues.
  - beta

  # "stable" components are, to the best of the author's knowledge, safe for
  # typical production use cases.
  - stable

# All OpenTelemetry APIs follow semver conventions (i.e., after v1.x,
# backwards-incompatible changes should bump the major version number).
apiMaturityLevels:
  # "unimplemented" APIs do not exist yet for the component/language.
  - unimplemented

  # "notApplicable" APIs do not and will never exist for the component/language
  # because they are, well, not applicable. For instance, a
  # zero-code-modification auto-instrumentation agent would be notApplicable
  # for C99.
  - notApplicable

  # "alpha" maturity APIs can change in incompatible ways at any time.
  - alpha

  # "beta" maturity APIs should not introduce backwards-incompatible changes
  # more than once every three months; and when those changes are introduced, the
  # authors will make a best effort to provide compatibility bridges.
  #
  # Also, for an API to be considered "beta", it must be supported by at least
  # two complete implementations, and at least one of those must be for a
  # well-known OSS project (e.g., Jaeger or Prometheus).
  - beta

  # "stable" maturity APIs should not introduce backwards-incompatible changes
  # more than once every twelve months, and will make every effort to provide
  # compatibility bridges if at all possible.
  - stable

# OPENTELEMETRY COMPONENTS
#
# Some OpenTelemetry components run within end-user applications and thus have
# a footprint across many languages. Naturally, the production and API maturity
# of these components varies from language to language. Other components run as
# infrastructure in their own containers or VMs and thus have a single maturity
# level regardless of the end-user's programming language.
#
# The maturity – or even the existence – of the "perLanguageComponents" varies
# from language to language. These are components that integrate into the
# actual end-user application runtime in production. See "languages" for the
# actual maturity levels.
perLanguageComponents:
  - traceAPI
  - metricsAPI
  - contextAPI
  - traceSDK
  - metricsSDK
  - contextSDK

# The maturity of the "standaloneComponents" is independent of any particular
# end-user programming language.
standaloneComponents:
  collector:
    api: alpha
    production: beta
  operator:
    api: alpha
    production: beta

# For each language, we either specify the perLanguageComponents maturity
# inline, or we specify a single "url" that points to another YAML file with a
# top-level perLanguageComponents key (presumably in the OpenTelemetry language
# repository). E.g., something like this:
#
# languages:
#   pascal:
#     repoUrl: "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-pascal"
#     maturityUrl: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-pascal/master/maturity.yaml"
