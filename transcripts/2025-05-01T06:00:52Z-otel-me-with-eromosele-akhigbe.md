# O Tell Me: Episode with Mole Aigbe

[Music]

**Adriana Vila**: Hey everyone, welcome to the latest edition of O Tell Me. My name is Adriana Vila, and I am one of the maintainers of the OpenTelemetry End User SIG. I'm super excited to have folks joining us here! Please feel free to share where you're joining from in the chat. I'm joining from Toronto, Canada.

I have some very special guests with me today. First of all, I have Victoria, who is co-hosting with me. Victoria, why don't you introduce yourself?

**Victoria**: Hi everyone! I'm Victoria, a user experience designer currently interning with the Prometheus project as an LFM. My project has got me interfacing with a lot of OpenTelemetry members, which is how I learned about this program. I'm looking forward to interviewing and learning all about Mole's experience.

**Adriana**: Awesome! And now it's time to introduce our guest, Mole Aigbe.

**Mole Aigbe**: Hello everyone! It's so nice to be here. Thank you so much, Adriana. My name is Mole Aigbe. I am a developer advocate at Sematext and also an OpenTelemetry member. I was a former Outreachy intern, and that’s where I got introduced to OpenTelemetry. I'm so excited to share my experience with OpenTelemetry here today. Thank you for having me!

**Adriana**: Amazing! So, Mole, you mentioned Outreachy in your introduction. Why don't you tell folks a little bit about the Outreachy program?

**Mole**: Sure! The Outreachy program is an initiative aimed at helping individuals from underrepresented and marginalized communities get into open source. They encourage these individuals to take their first steps into open source and provide incentives to assist them in doing so. Outreachy isn't just for open source; it's also for open science, covering diverse projects beyond just tech. Personally, my passion lies in tech, so that’s how I got to know about OpenTelemetry and the amazing community it has.

**Adriana**: Did you have any awareness of open source before you applied for Outreachy, or was Outreachy your introduction to it?

**Mole**: I always knew that open source existed, but I never thought someone like me could contribute. I believed that only people from big companies like Microsoft or Google could do it. I would watch YouTube videos on how to contribute and get scared, so I just ran away. However, Outreachy provided a platform with mentors who guided us through the step-by-step process of making our first contributions. Once I made that first contribution, I realized it wasn’t as hard as I thought; it was all in my head!

**Adriana**: That's amazing! Could you tell us more about the application process? What was it like?

**Mole**: I almost didn't apply because I thought, "This is open source; it's for the cool kids." But a good friend encouraged me to just apply, saying, "What's the worst that could happen?" So I decided to take that step. The application process involves writing five essays explaining why you believe you should be awarded the internship. Outreachy is not looking for the most skilled individuals; they focus on supporting people from marginalized backgrounds. The application is read by real people who are looking for those they can support.

Once you write the essays, there are two phases: the essay phase and the work phase. I struggled a lot during the work phase because I was learning Golang at the same time. I had just started learning about DevOps in December and had to learn Golang and contribute simultaneously. Thankfully, with the help of my mentors, I was able to make significant contributions and eventually got my internship!

**Adriana**: That's fantastic! I can't underscore enough the importance of programs like Outreachy because they provide opportunities for individuals who might not otherwise have them. How long was your internship?

**Mole**: The internship was for three months, but the entire application process took about six months.

**Adriana**: How did you get paired up with a mentor during the internship?

**Mole**: When you pick a project, each project has mentors who volunteer to guide participants. For OpenTelemetry, my mentors were Jurassi and Yuri, who were incredibly supportive throughout my journey.

**Adriana**: OpenTelemetry is a massive project. What specific areas did you contribute to?

**Mole**: Initially, I found it overwhelming to choose a repo to contribute to. I explored various repositories and eventually found solace in the collector contrib. During Outreachy, I worked on building a logging bridge in Golang and successfully built the Zero Log bridge for Golang by the end of my internship.

**Adriana**: That's incredible! Can you share how your internship helped you secure your first job?

**Mole**: After doing a lot of work, I started writing articles for a collaborative observability platform called Signals, which supports OpenTelemetry natively. My former boss, the CEO of Sematext, saw some of my articles and reached out to me. We had a conversation about my experience with OpenTelemetry, and I ended up working on building an exporter for their platform to receive data from OpenTelemetry directly. That's how I got my first job!

**Adriana**: That's a great story and really highlights how putting yourself out there can lead to amazing opportunities. What resources did you use to learn OpenTelemetry?

**Mole**: I started by Googling OpenTelemetry and looking at the documentation, but I found it overwhelming. Since I’m a visual learner, I turned to YouTube and found Henrik's channel. His videos provided a lot of context. I also read Adriana’s blogs, which helped me navigate the documentation better.

**Adriana**: That's great to hear! What was your experience like creating your first PR?

**Mole**: Creating my first PR was a journey! I spent about two weeks learning and studying other people's PRs. I read through closed issues and the corresponding PRs to understand how to contribute. Eventually, I found an issue I could tackle and reached out to the person to ask for assignment. I made mistakes, but the community was supportive. After two days, my PR got merged, and it felt like a huge milestone!

**Adriana**: That's such a glorious feeling! You mentioned working on the OpenTelemetry exporter. What was that experience like?

**Mole**: Building the exporter was challenging because there was little documentation on how to create one. I had to study existing exporters and adapt them to my needs. I utilized the OpenTelemetry Collector Builder and found resources on YouTube, which were incredibly helpful. After much trial and error, I managed to get my first metrics and logs into Sematext!

**Adriana**: It sounds like a significant learning experience! How did you learn Golang for this project?

**Mole**: I learned Golang in a very hands-on way, as I had to apply it to real-life projects. My teammates at Sematext were instrumental in guiding me, helping me understand what works in production. I also took a course that provided me with a solid context for using Golang effectively.

**Adriana**: Have you thought about documenting your journey or the process of creating the exporter?

**Mole**: I considered writing an article, but I realized that showing how I built it might not be useful to others because each context is different. Instead, I would encourage people not to give up and to study others' code as it has significantly helped me in my journey.

**Adriana**: That's great advice! What feedback do you have for improving the OpenTelemetry documentation?

**Mole**: I believe there should be more video documentation and clearer guidelines for building exporters. While the documentation is comprehensive, it can be overwhelming for beginners, so breaking it down or providing more visual aids would be beneficial.

**Adriana**: Absolutely! And what has your experience been like within the OpenTelemetry community?

**Mole**: The community is incredibly supportive and welcoming. My first interaction was a bit intimidating, but everyone was friendly and encouraging. I connected with my mentors and other community members, which made the experience much more enjoyable. I even attended KubeCon and met many people in person, which further solidified my appreciation for the community.

**Adriana**: That's wonderful to hear! Have you made any recent contributions to the community?

**Mole**: Yes! I've been advocating for OpenTelemetry in Nigeria, attending conferences, and helping others get started with OpenTelemetry and open source. I share my experiences and practical steps I took to help others in their journeys.

**Adriana**: That's amazing! It highlights that contributing to OpenTelemetry isn't just about code; it's also about advocacy and awareness. As we wrap up, does anyone from the audience have questions?

[Music]

**Adriana**: It seems we don’t have any questions. Before we go, I want to remind everyone about the Open Source Summit in Denver, Colorado, and the Open Observability Con. Also, if you're interested in joining the OpenTelemetry End User SIG, feel free to check out our GitHub repo and get involved.

Thank you so much, Mole, for joining us today, and thank you, Victoria, for co-hosting with me. This has been a lot of fun!

**Mole**: Thank you for having me!

**Victoria**: Thanks, everyone!

[Music] Hey everyone, welcome to the latest edition of O tellme. My name is Adriana Vila. I am one of the maintainers of the open telemetry enduser SIG. Um, super excited to have folks joining us here and please feel free in the chat to just say where you're joining from. I'm joining from Toronto, Canada. Um, I have some very special folks here joining today. First of all, um, I have Victoria who is co-hosting with me. So, Victoria, why don't you introduce yourself? Hi everyone. U, I'm Victoria. I'm a user experience designer. I'm currently interning with the Prometheus project as an LFM. Uh so from my project has got me interfacing with a lot of hotel members which is how I learn about this program. Uh and I'm looking forward to interviewing and learning all about his experience. Awesome. And now it's time to introduce our guest for mele. Hello everyone. It's so nice to be here. Thank you so much Adriana. Um my name is Mole Aigbe. I am a developer advocate at step security. I'm also an open telemetry member. I was a former algi intern and that's where I got introduced to open telemetry and I'm so excited to share my experience with hotel here today. Thank you for having me. Amazing. Yeah, super excited. So um well you know you mentioned um outreachy in your intro why don't you tell folks a little bit about the outreachy program. Okay. So, um the outreach program is is an initiative um that is that their aim is to help people that underrepresented communities, you know, marginalized, you know, look down on communities, you know, get into open source. They encourage them to get into open source to put their first leg into open source and then they also um give some kind of, you know, incentive, you know, to you know, assist them, right? to get their first leg in into open source you know the open source community at large. So that is what is that is what alry is and it's not just for open source you know it's for both open source and open science. So they have projects about um that covers biological things um projects that covers um geom maps you know different diverse projects not just open source projects but my my love since I'm a tech guy uh I love open source and that's where I got to know about open source and the amazing open telemetry community. Yeah. So did you were you aware of like open source before you you applied for outreachy or or like or or was outreachy like your awareness into open source then? Okay. So, yeah. So, I I always knew that open source existed, right? I always knew that, okay, there's something out there in the world called open source that some cool dudes that very smart, very intelligent are, you know, doing awesome work in, right? So, but I just never believed that someone like me could contribute to open source because I was like, bro, what do you know? You you do not work in Microsoft. You don't work in Google. You don't have that knowledge, man. You don't have experience. So just chill when you're you know when you are skilled enough maybe you can start you know playing in the big leagues right so open source was something I I remember you know several times I would use YouTube to how to contribute to open source and then I'll try to watch some videos I'll get scared and then I'll run away right so but ali you know provided that platform you know so we had mentors that actually directed and showed us you know the step-by-step process on how to make your first contribution and then once you make your first contribution realize that wait a second man it's not that it's not that hard it's it's not that hard it's all in your head right and then once you make that first contribution you know you keep I just kept making and making and then it just became so cool and cool so yeah so that's how I got to learn about I knew about open source but the altitude gave me the platform to take that first step into open source amazing Yeah, really interesting. Um, could you tell us more about the application process? What was it like? Okay. Uh, so first of all, I almost did not apply for uh I almost I almost did not apply for because I also had that whole mentality that okay man this is open source. This is for the cool kids. I'm not a cool kid, right? So I was like you know but my friend u my very good friend she was like no you can do it. you can just just apply. What's the what's what's the worst that can happen? They tell you no, you go back, you cry, and you're fine. So, I decided to take that step. I applied. So, what the application process is like is that you have to write like um five you have to write like five essays on um why you believe that you should be awarded um the the internship because like I said, the internship is not about they're not looking for very skilled people. They're looking to actually support, you know, people that are that come from, you know, the minorities of the society, like people that you would hear about on a normal on a regular day, right? Like people that um that are looked down on, you know, that people don't even like the big the big leagues don't even look at in the society. So that's their goal, right? So those are the people they are trying to support. So you can be quote unquote very smart or high and mighty and alone accept you. But you know if you feel like man who will hear my voice no one cares about me I'll say go for alry like they care like the people actually sit down and read people's essays to see and to look for those kind of people that they know that they can support. So I know people have heard a lot of things about job applications that they use one AI tracker to just wipe people applications but I can tell you from experience that out is not like that. real people actually read your essays and you can tell your story and through your story you know you might get a chance to you know walk into and begin your own open source journey. So you have to write five essays. Once you write the five essays you get into the first phase and then there's a actually two stages. The first phase is the essay phase where you have to you know prove that you need you know the internship and the second phase is where you actually have to now do the work and um in doing that work I'll say there a million times I wanted to give up because I did not know Golang so that's the language that you know most cloud native applications are written Golang I December like December 2023 that's two months before I was learning about um DevOps. So I just in that February I started learning Golang. So I was I was trying to learn open telemetry. I was trying to learn Golang and I was trying to contribute all in one month. So it was a whole lot. It was a whole lot. But you know I always I always say shout out to um Henrik and Adriana. their content really, you know, ramped me up, you know, to speed on how to on first understand the project and then make some reasonable contributions. So then I got the I was able to get like 70 hours merged and then I also spoke at and then my mentors were like, "You're so cool. Come on board." My mentors, by the way, Jurassic and Yuri are the coolest guys out there. Shout out to them. I love them so much with all my heart and I'm always grateful to them for the forever they will be part of my tech journey. I always mention their names everywhere I go, you know, as the ones that, you know, helped me like a baby and, you know, trained me up to be this man that I am now. So, yeah. So, that's like a summary of the application process. Yeah, that's so great. And you know, I can't underscore enough the importance of programs like Outreachy because they give opportunities to people who otherwise wouldn't necessarily have gotten the opportunity and and especially like nowadays I'm going to get on my little soap box and and talk about the fact that like so many DEI programs are getting cut and there's so much I don't know there's like global hate towards DEI programs and like so it's so nice to have a reminder that um programs like Outreach exist. They benefit folks. Um they elevate folks that who are awesome who we wouldn't necessarily have known about. And and so like I I love that. I love that you got so much out of the program. Um I love that the program exists. Um I wanted to ask you um so how long how long was your how long was your internship? Okay, so the internship was for three months. Um but if I want to combine the whole application process everything together was like six months right but officially the internship is just for three months you know so that's how long the internship was awesome and uh you talked a little bit about um about your mentors how do you get how do you get paired up with a mentor okay so um when you pick a project every project has you know mentors for the project right so when I picked the project open telemetry it was Jurassi and um Yuri that were they actually volunteer so it's not so they actually volunteered to be mentors for a particular project right and so they volunteered to be mentors of the open telemetry project at that time and then that's how they became my mentors cool Okay. So I would like to ask I know I know that hotel is a very big project. So what specific areas of hotel what specific areas did you contribute to doing? Okay. Um so the I'll go before the actual internship I I remember scrolling through the different repos on GitHub and I was like oh my god where do I even start from? And I I'll say I found I tried some things in the golang sig the go sig um the go the golang instrumentation but my go was not very very strong so I think no no PR got merged there but then I now found a lot of solace in the collector contrip um sig um the collector contrib right and that's why I made um some contributions to to get into the outri and in outrichy the project that I worked on was building a login bridge in Golang and by the end of the internship I was able to build the zero log bridge um for Golang. Yeah. So that's those are the projects that I'm working on and then currently I still contribute to the collector contributions. Wow. But like it's funny to see how you went from not knowing about school to completing your internship to to building something that the community is making. That's that's huge. So So I'm um uh Yeah. Could you could you share with us how the African internship helped you secure your first job? Okay. Uh so how Okay. What happened was I had done a lot of work and then I was writing articles for signals. Um signals very cool collab observability platform also um support open telemetry natively. So I was writing articles for signals and I think my former boss um Otus the CEO of sematex saw some of the articles that I wrote and you know had a conversation with me that oh hey man you worked on open telemetry right? I'm like yeah I did. What did you do? I showed him what I did. We got on a call um I did some demos on how auto instrumentation works. He was like wow this is so cool. I was like yeah it's so cool. Oh, open telemetry is so cool. And he was like, okay, that they want to um, you know, integrate their platform with open telemetry and and am I up for it? I'm like, okay, sure, I'm up for it. Let's go. You know, and uh, so in seatex what I was working on was building an exporter for their platform to so that they can receive, you know, data from open hotel data into their platform directly using the collector open telemetry collector. So that so that was the project I worked on while at seat text and it was it was very stressful but it was very cool. It was very cool in the end. Yeah. So yeah. So that's that's how I got my first job. The contributions I did and the some demos I did about hotel. That's what I got my first job. Yeah. That's amazing. And I think you know it really underscores like two things. First of all, like outreachy kind of gave you the tools, right, to um to contribute to open source, contribute to open telemetry, but then you did another awesome thing, which is putting yourself out there, writing these blog posts, um which is so so important. And it's so hard sometimes to like put ourselves out there. Um and you know and we I think we all in tech suffer um from imposttor syndrome at some point or another maybe constantly feel it comes in waves for me. Um and you just have to push past that imposttor syndrome and do it anyway. Um so mega kudos to what you're doing. Now you've made a few references about um you know learning learning open telemetry learning go what did you use for um can you dig a little bit deeper on on on how you learned um open tele okay yeah so I'll start from my first introduction to open telemetry I just Google open telemetry enter and I saw the documentation I was like oh this looks so cool and then I tried to read the docs and my brain wanted to blow So I went to so I'm more of a visual learner, right? So I went to YouTube and I typed what is open telemetry and um Henrik um he is the the owner or you're the owner of the channel and is it observable right and I was just watching a lot of his videos at that time and I would say those videos gave me a lot of context right because how I learned is I first I I like specific information before general information so I use his videos a lot to ramp up on my knowledge on hotel And then our wonderful uh co-host here, Hadriana. Her blogs, her blogs are so awesome. I I read a lot of our blogs, you know, at that time just to ramp up because the documentation was very overwhelming for me. So after reading those two things, I then began to go to the docs and actually, you know, narrow down on what I was looking for. So I really knew what I was looking for because documentation sometimes can be very overwhelming because there's so much information packed in the documentation and it's trying to you know talk to different classes of people both beginners, intermediate and advanced people. So beginners sometimes always feel overwhelmed right from those documentation. But I'll say um when it came to running the open telemetry demo the docs did a good job. Yeah did a good pretty good job on how to run the open telemetry demo which was pretty cool. But yeah, so those were the resources I I used. I bought more YouTube videos, but these are the resources that really, you know, accelerated my learning journey to make that first contribution to telemetry. Yeah. Wow, that's great. Personally, I'm more I'm more of a reader like I prefer to consume text based resources than watching. Cool. I'm with you on that. So that's interesting interesting to know. Good for you. So of all these resources that you mentioned, the YouTube videos, which of them would you say was the most um useful for you to learn about? So you you want me to pick one? [Laughter] You want me one? one or two if it's too hard to choose. If you tell me to pick one, I'm I'm very biased. I always go for videos. So, you tell me to pick one, I'll go for Henrik's channel. Hands up. I mean, Henrik produces amazing content, so I I can definitely vouch for that. Yep. Yeah. So, for Okay, so I won't pick one. I'll divide them into sections. So, for video, I'll say Henrik's channel. Is it observable? If you haven't, go and check it out. It's awesome. And then for text, Adriana's blog on Medium. I don't Adriana Adriana's blog. I don't know if she's hearing me right now. Adriana's blog. Yeah. So, yeah, you should also check that out, right? Yeah. So, those are the two most useful resources. Uh, yeah, that's cool. Yeah. Okay. Um, now you said you you have a preference for the videos, right? Is there a reason why? Okay. So, is there something particular about those? Yeah. Okay. So, uh, so how I how I reason is I'm a very imaginative thinker. Like I I can sit down and just go on and just be imagining a lot of things. So, I like things I like pictures, visual things because if I'm just reading a bunch of text of of a concept I haven't understood yet, I get bored like I will just easily get bored and do off. So, if I'm watching a video, you know, the sound of the person, the tone, the the infographics, the pictures, you know, just keeps me excited to keep going and keep going and keep going and keep going and before I know it, I've tricked my brain into learning a new concept, right? So, yeah. So that's just what that's just what works for me. I've observed it over time. Yeah, that's it. That's awesome. Yeah, makes sense. Um the the next question that we were wondering about, you know, you mentioned that you use the uh the hotel ducks as a as a reference and you know, one of the one of the goals of these sessions um that we have like with hotel me is also to provide feedback um to the hotel community on on areas for improvement. Um, is there anything like why is it that the you found um third-party um documentation more useful than the official hotel docs? Um, and what made you go back to them afterwards? And and what would you So this like multi-art question, sorry. And what what would you what would you do to improve the docs experience if it if it were up to you as as like a new learner? Okay. Uh so sorry this is an issue with multiple questions. The first question is I hope I remember them. The first question is um what made me uh feedback for the docs or maybe leave the docs or Yeah. Why why did you choose why did you choose uh third party documentation uh over over the hotel docs for starters? Okay. So, uh well because number one, there's no video documentation yet. That's why fair. Yeah. Fair. Yeah. But um also when I'm reading someone's content, right? Like I'm learning your content or someone else out there. I am not just reading like I can feel I'm feeling I feel human connection like I can like you can say something like ah I got stuck at this. this is what I had to do and then this got you know solved but in a documentation it's just man it's just it's like reading a textbook you know there you know do this do this do this do that move on you know but you know when you're writing your content you can say oh do this if this does not work try this you try this out if this does not work try this out so I'll say that's why I preferred you know to go for like I said the when I enter the document doumentation I I got overwhelmed cuz I was scrolling through a lot of things I was scrolling through then I didn't understand what instrumentation was and then documentation has so many links that link you to so many things and before you know you're lost in the rabbit hole of the documentation so I'll be reading something I'm like instrumentation I'll see a link I'll click the link I'm going to you know a different entire part and then before you know I was like where am I what am I learning so I got overwhelmed right so so how would I if I had that opportunity How would I okay what what made me go back to the docs? What made me go back to the docs is I already had like I already built a foundation. So I was not overwhelmed when I saw what is instrumentation or when I saw what is a collector. So imagine someone that is new that does not know anything about a collector trying to learn open telemetry is and then he's seen open telemetry what is open telemetry you can't really define open telemetry without the four components instrumentation collector and he's like what what is open telemetry operator? Oh my gosh, he's seen Kubernetes like where am I, you know? So, um I already got that foundational knowledge. So, I could now go and head for the docs, right? And because now I already knew what I was looking for in the documentation. So, let's say I want to do I want to do a particular task. I can just search for that particular part in the docs and focus on just that side. And um so what would I do to improve the doc experience? I'll say I'll make a video documentation for you know we for for those who uh do follow the uh hotel content we do have our first video like instructional video on the uh hotel YouTube channel. So um and and there's there will be more to come. So that's great feedback. Yes. So you can also um you know because there are two different kinds of learners. they are visual learners and they are, you know, text based learners. So, they're satisfying both at the same time. So, that's what I was saying. Yep. Yep. That is a super fair point and I I I like that. Um it it's interesting too like what you were saying um that basically use the um the hotel docs for like more of a a directed directed search, right? like first understand stuff um from people's experiences and then okay I want to learn about this I will go into the docs to learn about that that's kind of that that's really cool that's the approach that's worked for me um to learn everything and that's what I'll keep using by the way Adrian I started learning Kubernetes just a side side note oh right on good luck good luck I'll journey It's a journey. I think you'll find it fun though. You're a problem solver. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Um, could you tell us what your experience was like creating your first PR? Ah, okay. We're here. So, creating my first PR, uh, I'll say it was a whole experience, right? I so after watching some videos, reading some documentation I think I did this for for two weeks I was just learning a whole lot and then I was like you know what you need to make your first PR like you can't waste any more time and then so I went to the the um the repos and I was like okay so which repo do I pick I think I think that that that was the first issue I had you know so open telemetry has a bunch of repos so I was like so which one do I go for so I think some for a while I was just lost in do I contribute to NodeJS do I know node I don't know node let me go to collector do I know I'm like okay then so what I started doing um was I started reading other people's PRs so I would literally go to an issue that is closed go under the PR you know because when an issue is closed the link to the PR that you know close the issue will always be there I'll literally go and be studying their code so like that's That's why I did a lot I don't think I've said share this anywhere before but that's why I did a lot I would go and literally be studying people's PR studying their code studying how they you know framed things okay this is how you write this in go because remember I was still learning go at this point so it's so so it was like a it was like a I was like um learning so much in one month because I was studying people's code I was doing a course at the same time right so and then after studying people's peer I was over a while I now gained some confidence I now I found an issue that someone had done something similar you know that's the beautiful thing about open source sometimes you want to update you know a bunch of components at the same time and I saw a similar issue to one of the peers I had studied and I was like you know I can tackle this and I asked you know I asked hello my name is this can I please be assigned to this issue I didn't think the person will answer me and he was like oh yeah sure why not go ahead I think I think his username is MX-Psi I don't know his real MX-PS psi sorry and he was like why not go ahead and you know I tried it out I made a m I made mistakes obviously because I was new to go I didn't understand the whole lint check thing but he then he you know like I said open telemetry community is so wonderful um they do not look down on you they don't look down on where you are as long as you're honest right don't come and prove to be a senior developer when you actually not like come clean I told the guy man I haven't done this before please help my life. I went to his DMs and he was like, "Okay, do this, do this, do this." And you know, at the end of, you know, I think after two days, he got merged. I was like, "Yay, my first PR." And then from there it just it was just like a full journey, right? It was a full journey, you know, from there. Really really nice journey. So that was my my summarized experience. I don't want to go into the details of me crying and, you know, want to tear my Yeah, that was that was just a summarized experience. Yeah, I I I have to agree with you that like that first PR getting merged is like the most glorious experience ever. But I will tell you like every time I have a PR merged, I do like a little happy dance at home. It's like, oh my god, I'm up for something. By the way, I I I gotta say like hats off to you um in your approach to to working on issues too, like studying the the PRs and the code behind the PRs. you you have the heart and soul of a software engineer. It's like you were made for this. That's amazing. And I I think this is a good lead in um also to our our uh next um area that we want to talk about which is um I believe you mentioned earlier that you uh did some work on creating an hotel exporter uh for the collector. So um do talk about that. What was that experience like? Okay, I have a lot of funny experiences. Sorry. Um, so when I got the project um with my former company, Simex, uh I was like, okay, let's do this, right? How hard can it be? So I went to the documentation and there was no documentation on how to create an exporter, right? uh the only documentation was was how to create a receiver and I was trying to understand it and it wasn't working because one one thing I now realized later that I didn't know then was that an exporter there's no really after there's no standard way of creating an exporter well there there's a template you have to follow but there's no standardized way because you know exporters depend on your vendor back end so in semantex um the we're receiving logs over influx live protocol call and then we were sorry receiving metrics over influx 5 protocol and then we were in we're receiving um logs over um what's that thing called what's that thing called elastic yeah elastic bulk index format right so I had to build an exporter that would convert hotel data to these two sources so what I what I did like I did for my other PRs let me just summarize you know like I said I would avoid all the days of shouting and panicking and running around and I'll go straight to the point. I started studying other other people's exporter. So I studied influx DB exporter because that way our metrics you know that's what our metrics exp the metric side of exporter would look like. Then I studied elastic elastic search exporter like I did a lot of study. I tried to break down a lot of things with my the help of my assistant cha [Laughter] great assistant. Yeah. So I I I broke I try to break it down. I try to um fit things in our own context. So how do I take this part from here, put it here, remove this part, you know? So it was a whole trial and error. I did a lot of trial and error. Um there was really no content that I could that I could look to that okay this is what assisted me in this journey. Oh sorry pardon me on that. I remember the open telemetry collector builder. So while learning while learning how to build um the exporter I had to use the OCB open telemetry collector builder and that's when I came across bind planes content on YouTube also really we had they have a full series on open telemetry collector very wonderful series I enjoyed every build so that's why I learned how to use the open telemetry collector builder so yeah so that really helped and the OCB is very fun it's so cool man it's like you can build your own custom collector you know with whatever component you want like you It's so it's cool. It's like play-doh, right? You can build as you want, play with it as you want, connect things, join things, break things, and you know, it's fine. So I So I learned how to use the OCB. And then in time, after lots of trial and error, I got my first metric in to SEAR text and it siting exciting feeling, right? And then after a while again got the logs in and then awesome. Then I I built the exporter. So that was that was the that was the summarized version of the experience of building the exporter. Yeah, it's really interesting. Uh believe me, I'm sharing in your excitement right now. I can I can only imagine. Um so for our next question could you tell us a bit about learning go to be able to work on this hotel exporter that you just talked about. So learning go has been a very interesting journey because it has I I did not learn go the normal way right the normal way just watching a course and just building some you know interesting projects you know maybe to-do app stuff. I learned go the hard way because I was actually actually had to like I was learning it and I had to apply it directly into real life projects that go into production, right? So I I remember I I had a help I had a lot of help from the people I worked with at Semantex. Bora Bora Akshhat really cool guys part of my team. So they were so so I'll make mistakes. They were like no they'll be like no error this is not the right way to do this. I know this is the YouTube way, this is the um course way, but in production this would break, this would fail. So I say I learned go handon you know contributing to things right. So it was a very interesting journey. I actually had I got a course from code cloud gave me a lot of like I said I like contextual things. So I had a full context of what go looks like. So I could understand code if you give me any Golan code I can know okay this is what this is what this is struck this is an interface this is what this does this what should do but then I had a lot of you know building things in real life and I feel like that's really the best way to learn you know although it's very stressful uh you would feel you feel very dumb sometimes because some things will I remember sometimes at night I'll literally be up by 2:00 a.m. time and detest keep failing and I'm like please just run please just run I'll literally be praying I'm praying over and over and over and over again and then finally run and I'll be like yay let's go another milestone achieved so so that I'll say that that was my whole experience learning golang and you know becoming that golang engineer yeah cool um throughout Throughout our conversation, you've talked a lot about the resources that helped you to learn open telemetry, that helped you to learn Google and helped you to build the auto exporter. Now, could you tell me what uh what plan you had for documenting this this exporter that you that you when you said so that other people Okay. So, what do you mean document it? Do you mean like you want me to document my journey or how I built a portment? Can you clarify documentation for Sorry, I I I didn't get you for I lost you for like two seconds. Sorry. Yeah, I said documentation for the exporter itself for those who who would be using it. Yeah. Okay. So, I think um when when you're contributing an exporter, there's actually a template of documentation that you actually have to, you know, just do. Well, I'll I'll answer your question from the standpoint because I think Adriana and I spoke about this um I think last time and uh so even if I document and she actually put an idea that I should write an article on how it is not really possible to show you how to build an exporter because I tried actually sat down after building exporter I was like okay how can I help the community with this and I'm like even if I show you how I did it it's not going to be useful to you because your context might be different, right? It might be different. So I what I would say is maybe I the the article I can write on or maybe the documentation will be don't give up. Try try try again. Even when it fails, keep trying. It's going to work. And then another thing I'll say is study study other code. Stud study other people's code. Like I'll say that's one thing has helped me in my whole coding journey and has really accelerated my speed is that I I um always studied people's code and understood the patterns in the code. So from understanding those patterns I can now create my own you know find how to remove parts and then join to what I'm looking for. So yeah. So it's more of a a process rather because I I guess from the sounds of it like um I think the other two components um uh receivers and and processors I think there is like some documentation around around creating those because it's more formulaic right whereas exporters are not but then I guess the thing that's in common is like what's the thought process that you need for creating it but not this is the exporter template Yeah, this is step step by step. Now, yeah, I I think that would be such a great blog post to write. Um because I think, you know, again, it all goes back to what you were saying too about like um some of these third party sources are about personal experiences and having that human touch, human connection. And I think that would be so beneficial. Um, it would also be interesting, I'm just giving an idea, um, to put in the docs, um, something along the lines of like why is it that we don't have a template for creating hotel exporters? Because that was like I remember I at some point I uh, I was I was looking into that as well and I'm like, I don't get it. Why Why is there no template for this? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, there's no official template. I think it's it's when you start and then you know you speak to the the um the maintainers they not tell you oh no no no this should be here this shouldn't be here I'll be like okay let's sh change it things up right so I think yeah I think there should be an official like okay this is the maybe we can't help you to build the full thing but this these are the things you need you need a config file you need this file you need a factory go file you know things around that so yeah yeah I think Uh that's great. Um and then the uh the other thing that you mentioned that um I want to dig into is the hotel collector builder. Um and specifically like what was your um what was your experience around that? Cuz you know I I've played around with the builder. You've played around with the builder. Was it was it as easy as you thought it would be? Um and if not, what would you say is some feedback that you would like to give on what can be done to make it easier? Okay. So, um you know, in my journey, and I'm going to be very very honest here, right? In my journey with um learning to try to get the um understand the exporter. I didn't really get um any good information from the documentation. So, I'll say for for a while I just did not look at the docs anymore. I just went to YouTube and was doing the research. So that's why I found um bind plane right and then they did a whole video on how to build your own custom collector like 45 46 minutes video and that basically showed me okay yeah so this this works this can do this and then I think also the readme files so I think there's even some like some of the like the open entry collector builder it's more documented in the readme file than well at that time than the documentation itself. So I I think I got more value from the um from the readme file from the readme files at that time than the actual documentation. I don't know if it has been updated yet. I'll probably check but yeah. So I I did just uh get a PR merged in the uh in the hotel docs um about like cuz when I was doing it um I'm like okay I built this DRO how the hell do I containerize it? and there was no documentation around that and I had to ask and then I wrote a blog post about it but I'm like it should be in the docs too. So I just had that PR merged I think today or yesterday. So that's cool. That's so cool. Yeah. So that was my experience with the OCD telemetry. Awesome. All right. Uh I think I have just one more question. Could you could you tell us a bit about the hotel community and I what's your Yeah, I I would like to know your first impression of the community. How you able to collaborate with the community from the time you contributed to Yeah. as an agent and beyond that beyond the Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um so the open telemetry community I love you all so much but uh so my my first my first experience with them was uh I introduced myself hello guys I am an I am so I used to be introverted some sort of way but the people don't really believe because you know I'm I'm very outspoken but I used to be introverted right so I was kind of shy uh because I was like okay I'm a newbie I don't really know much about stuff I don't know anything about open source who listened to me right and I was like hello my name is I'm from my Nigeria nice to meet you all and people said hi back right people people waved back oh nice to meet you welcome to open tele community and I was like oh that's so cool and then um I'll say when I stumbled into a lot of like back to my mentors right Yuri so Jorassi was um Yuri was my major mentor for the for the outreach internship so we had a lot of calls, right? And in those calls, he just keep encouraging me that I know this is tough, but don't worry, you're going to get it. Just keep just keep pushing, you know, keep trying. I said, I believe in you. You know, he's come, I believe in you. I know you can do this. So, you know, he was always just encouraging me. And then even not just my mentors, you know, it was like a collective effort. So, like I said, I've said this before, I'll go to some people's DMs and I'll be like I'll be crying that please help me. I don't understand this p this issue. How do I solve it? You've already assigned it to me. I tried this. It did not work. And they'll be like, "Okay, you know what? Try this. Make this change." And then I'll keep disturbing them and they'll keep replying. And I remember when I wrote my first blog my first blog post on on open telemetry and I had already like read some bunch of Adriana's blog posts and I was like I'm going to send I was like I'm going to send a DM to Adriana because I like to hear her thoughts on my blog post and I was like hello Adriana hi I'm Shington please can you review my blog post for me and she and she replied and she went I reviewed my blog post and I was like wow she doesn't know me from anywhere you know uh we are not in the same continent or in different from different tribes and she's actually willing to you know assist right so I was like oh that's so cool so I would say open community they are very loving I can't really vouch for a lot of open source communities right but I can vouch for the open telemetry community that they really cool and it's a very nice community to join by the way I'm now a member of the open community so you can also text me I'm very cool if you have questions about and she can text me. I'm cool. Like they are also cool, right? So the community is loving, nice, really caring and I love it. But then when I got to CubeCon and I met everyone in person, it was like way cooler. I met Adriana in person. I met Heric. I met Tras and some other really awesome people. It was really nice. So yeah, they're really nice community to join and be part of. Yeah, I'm I'm going to completely agree with everything just said because I just recently joined the community too and everyone has been about Adriana plus one to that. She's very cool. Yep. And and it's been nice getting to interact with her. Uh one more question before we go. Um have have you made any recent I believe as an hotel community member now you have to contribute to hotel community. So have you had any recent um contributions to the community that you like to talk about? Yeah. Okay. So um what I have been doing majorly right now is um so in in the Nigerian space I think when I came back from CubeCon I think when I started learning the whole open telemetry thing I realized that open telemetry was not a topic that was spoken about a lot in my you know my country locally you know Africa because Kubernetes is very popular here everyone knows Kubernetes right so um open telemetry is not really heard a lot so I I started advocating a lot about I think that's how I even slided into my developer advocate role. So currently I'm a developer advocate. I'm not a full software engineer anymore. Um so I started you know attending conferences um talking about open telemetry showing people how to get started with open telemetry how to um get into open source you know that those because I experienced you know I'll say I experienced the the dramas the struggles you know so I I understand when people come to me and tell me I'm so confused about open source how do I start so I understand yeah and I can also give them practical steps I took to you know get started so I would say I've been doing more of that and then I'm actually still the exporter has not it has been built fully but I'm still pushing it into you know because open source takes time you can't just throw things inside there's a whole process so the exporter is still being pushed into um the the open telemetry collector contrib so I'll say that is the in aside um related to code that those are the contributions that I've been making but then I've been doing more of advocacy you know about open telemetry you know in my Yeah, that's that's amazing. And I think that's that makes a a really good point as well. Um because contributing to open telemetry isn't just about the PRs that you're making. It's also about the advocacy um the bringing that awareness. So I think that's that's great. And um I think this wraps up the the the main Q&A and we do have a few uh minutes left. So if anyone from the audience has any questions that they would like to ask at this point um we are happy to take your questions. I feel like we need some music. This is where you take out the guitar for this for this. Dang it. Who the with the music? Is that you? Was that I think that was Henrik, our amazing producer. Well, it doesn't look like we have any questions. So, um, what I will say is we'll I guess we'll wrap up, but before we go, um, a few quick announcements, promotions. Um, first of all, for anyone who is planning on attending OpenSource Summit in Denver, Colorado, there's also going to be as as a coll-located event, there's an open observability con and hotel community day that is going on. Um, the CFPs for hotel community day are closed, but open observability con CFPs are still open. Um, and that's going to be at the end of June. So, um, feel free to submit CFPs to attend if you're in the area if you're planning on attending. Open source summit also is like lots of fun. Um, it's like CubeCon light. It's all the awesome people who attend without like without the flash. So, uh, it's tons of fun. Um the other thing um for anyone who is interested um as I mentioned I'm one of the maintainers of the hotel and user sig. Victoria is a newly joined member of the hotel and user sig. So um if you're interested in joining us seeing what we're up to um Henrik just flashed a link for our GitHub repo. Um we do a bunch of things like these types of events. We have hotel me. We have hotel and practice where if anyone who's watching is interested um if you have like a topic uh an observability hotel topic that you'd like to present on maybe you're testing out a a topic for a conference for a talk um want to flesh it out use us um just DM us uh on the hotel end user SIG Slack um and just you know just let us know if you're interested in in in uh doing a presentation for hotel in practice and we also run uh we also uh join forces with the various hotel sigs to run surveys. So um stay tuned there will be more surveys heading your way. The surveys are a great way to for us to get um feedback from our user community on ways to improve the SIGs. So that information is super important, super valuable um to the community. So thank you to the folks who have responded to the surveys. Thank you to the folks who have engaged in the hotel end user SIG. Um also um for those who aren't able to attend and for those who were able to attend, tell your friends that this video will be posted um on our hotel YouTube channel. It's hotel-official on YouTube. Um you can catch all of our previous hotel and practice and hotel me um sessions. And also we do have our first how-to hotel video on on the hotel YouTube channel. So for for those who are visual learners, this is your opportunity to check that out. Um, thank you so much Edoselle for joining and for Victoria for co-hosting uh with me today. This has been lots of fun. Always enjoy having these conversations and um we will see everyone at the next event. Sure. Thanks, Adriana. Thank you. Thanks, Father. Thanks, Victoria. It was nice meeting you. [Music]
