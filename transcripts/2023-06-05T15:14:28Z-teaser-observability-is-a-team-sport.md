## Summary

In this video, the speaker discusses the concept of observability as a collaborative effort within teams rather than a responsibility solely held by observability specialists. The speaker emphasizes the importance of involving all engineers in the observability process, as they have a deeper understanding of their own code and products. The goal is to empower engineers with the necessary tools and guidance while encouraging them to take charge of observability tasks, such as instrumentation, alert creation, and response. The video highlights the shift from a centralized observability approach to a more inclusive team-oriented strategy.

# Observability as a Team Sport

Today, I want to discuss a topic that I am extremely passionate about: **observability as a team sport**. 

In many companies, observability teams are tasked with creating guidelines, instrumenting the code, setting up alerts, and responding to incidents. However, I am completely against this approach. I believe that observability should be a shared responsibility. 

**Engineers know their code and their products better than anyone else.** As observability engineers, our role should be to help and empower them by providing the necessary tools, but it should ultimately be the engineers who take charge of observability in their projects. 

Thatâ€™s the essence of what I want to convey today.
