## Summary

In this video, the speaker discusses the importance of documentation and guidelines in implementing OpenTelemetry for engineers. They emphasize that while engineers are skilled in their own code, the sessions are designed to share best practices and introduce the tools available to them, highlighting that effective instrumentation is a collaborative effort. The speaker underscores the supportive role of their team in facilitating this process.

Thank you. 

We provide documentation and guidelines, and there is a lot of very good information in OpenTelemetry about manual instrumentation. Essentially, we have sessions with engineers—not to train them, as I believe they can do it better than we can since it’s their code—but to showcase best practices and introduce them to these concepts. We want to remind them that our tools are here to support them, and from there, they take it and run with it. It's a team sport, let's say. Thank you.

[Music] thank you we provide documentations we provide guidelines and there is a lot of very good documentations in the open Telemetry as well about manual instrumentation so basically we have sessions with Engineers uh not to train them because I think they can do it better than we can because it's their their code but just to show the best practices and to introduce them to that and to tell them that hey our tools are are here for you and it they take it from there it's a team sport let's say thank you
