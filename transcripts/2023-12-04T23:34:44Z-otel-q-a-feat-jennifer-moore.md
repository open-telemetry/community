# OTEL Q&A with Jennifer Moore

[Music]

Welcome everyone to the OTEL Q&A. We are super excited to have Jennifer Moore with us today. Welcome, Jennifer!

**Jennifer:** Hi, thanks!

**Host:** Okay, so I guess first things first. I asked Jennifer to come on because I had talked to her previously about some experiences she had at a prior company around OTEL, and I thought it was a really interesting and compelling story. So, let's start with some background. This is not at your current employer but at a previous one. Can you give us some background on their application stack?

**Jennifer:** Sure! This was a whole job ago, and all of this was happening about a year ago, so some details may be fuzzy for me. The company is called Screencastify, and they make a screen recording application. They were in the early days of version two, which would include video hosting and editing services, whereas before it had just been a screen recorder that saved to whatever storage you had handy.

The stack included lots of TypeScript, running in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and containers. The main backend was a TypeScript server, likely Next.js, running in Google Cloud Run, which is a serverless container product. Everything being serverless will be relevant here. The backend handled routine web service tasks like account management and billing, as well as on-demand video encoding.

We also had what we called a task system or job system that ran in Kubernetes. This consisted of multiple Kubernetes microservices that responded to video uploads and edits for transcoding and processing work, powered by a message queue.

**Host:** What was your role at the company?

**Jennifer:** I joined as the DevOps lead. A lot of what I did there was to drive DevOps practices and handle the day-to-day tasks of DevOps, such as working on CI/CD pipelines, observability, internal tooling, and developer experience. Anything that wasn't primarily focused on building a feature in the application likely crossed my keyboard at some point.

**Host:** That's a lot of hats to wear! You mentioned observability. Did the company recognize a big enough need for it when you joined?

**Jennifer:** Yes, somewhat. They had encountered the concept and made some starts at observability. There were definitely people who recognized it as a good idea, and nobody was fighting against it. However, they didn't really know what to expect from it, and the efforts felt scattered. They had some tracing but it was disconnected and not useful, so most information came from logs before I took on that responsibility.

**Host:** When you started implementing observability, what motivated you?

**Jennifer:** My motivation was to better understand what the system was doing. As a senior engineer, I needed to support these systems, and that's basically impossible without knowing what they are and how they behave. After a while, I grew uncomfortable lacking that understanding and decided to remove the ineffective auto-instrumentations and start instrumenting things more consistently.

**Host:** So you went into the application code and started instrumenting?

**Jennifer:** Mostly, I removed the existing auto-instrumentations from tools like DataDog that weren't helpful for us and replaced them with OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentations, which worked for everything we wanted. Suddenly, my flame graphs filled out, and I could see what was going on from start to finish.

**Host:** How was the learning curve with OpenTelemetry? Was it something you were familiar with initially?

**Jennifer:** I was familiar with it conceptually. I spent a lot of time on Twitter talking to observability and resilience folks, so I understood the goals and concepts. However, the actual mechanics of turning on and using OpenTelemetry was new to me.

**Host:** Did you have anyone from your team assisting you?

**Jennifer:** I didn't want to be the only person who knew how it worked, so I did the initial setup but made sure to distribute follow-up work to the rest of the DevOps team. I wanted others to understand what was going on.

**Host:** How was that received within your team?

**Jennifer:** It went really well. Distributed tracing has some inherent complexity, so there was a learning ramp-up, but after going through that, everyone was pleased and happy to have it.

**Host:** Did you see favorable results from this implementation?

**Jennifer:** Yes, I started seeing favorable results, and while I noticed improvements, management was initially neutral but became more positive as we encountered incidents. They realized the value of having observability when problems arose.

**Host:** Did this incentivize developers to do additional work, like manual tracing?

**Jennifer:** Yes, some engineers were very on board with the idea of tracing and wanted to dive deeper. While some were neutral, nobody was actively against it. Unfortunately, organizational changes limited the opportunities for more extensive manual tracing.

**Host:** Did you end up implementing an OTEL collector?

**Jennifer:** Yes, I wanted to do that. The company was already invested in DataDog, so moving toward an OpenTelemetry setup was a process. I started it, and my understanding is that everything is now OpenTelemetry, with a move away from DataDog to another vendor. 

**Host:** That’s great to hear! Have you been able to apply what you learned at your previous workplace to your current role?

**Jennifer:** Yes and no. I am currently at Influx Data, where the engineering focus has been on getting the 3.0 version of the database ready. Now that we’ve achieved that, there’s an opportunity to think about observability and OpenTelemetry again, but the focus is more on making the database a better backend for collecting spans and telemetry data rather than instrumenting our applications.

**Host:** What were the most challenging aspects of implementing OpenTelemetry in your previous organization?

**Jennifer:** The most challenging part was that there had already been a start with a vendor's proprietary SDK, which confused things. I initially tried to leave that in place while I instrumented with OpenTelemetry, but it made traces more confusing. I wish I had removed the proprietary SDK sooner.

Another challenge was that there were areas without existing auto-instrumentations. For example, I had to write my own auto-instrumentation for BigQuery because it didn’t have one. That was a learning curve, but also a benefit because it allowed me to create something useful for us.

**Host:** How did your fellow DevOps engineers gain skills in OpenTelemetry?

**Jennifer:** The majority was through hands-on experience. After I set up the initial auto-instrumentation, I made a point to have others take it further. We also had a strong learning culture, including a technical book club where we read *Observability Driven Development*, which helped familiarize many people with the concepts.

**Host:** Any feedback for the OpenTelemetry project as a whole?

**Jennifer:** The early onboarding and learning curve can be steep. Improving that would be great. Also, it would have been nice to have more stability in metrics and logging during my time, as a consistent interface for all telemetry signals would have been very convenient.

**Host:** Thank you, Jennifer! Does anyone else have questions?

**Audience Member:** Can you elaborate on the consistent interface for telemetry signals?

**Jennifer:** Sure! With OpenTelemetry, spans are easier to configure and send to a collector, compared to logs and metrics, which require separate configurations. It would be helpful to send logs and metrics to the collector in the same way spans are sent, without making those things application concerns.

**Host:** I believe we're getting closer to that. 

**Jennifer:** Yes, I think we are, especially with the correlation of logs to traces, which tells a fuller story.

**Host:** Thank you, Jennifer, for sharing your inspiring story. It highlights that when things are broken, observability becomes essential. This has been a great session!

We have an upcoming Q&A on December 7th with someone from HashiCorp who has attempted to instrument Nomad. Stay tuned for that!

Thanks again, Jennifer, and we'll let you know once the video is posted!

[Music] so welcome everyone to otel Q&A we are super excited to have Jennifer Moore with us today welcome Jennifer uh hi thanks um okay so I guess first things first so I asked Jennifer to come on because um I had talked to her previously um about some experiences that she had had at a prior company around otel um and I thought it was a really really interesting and compelling story so um I guess we'll start with h why don't you give us some background I know this is it's not at your current employer it's at a previous employer why don't you give us some background of you know their uh for starters like what their their application stack was like um and um and then go from there sure um this was a whole job ago and all of this was happening like a year ago so um some of the details will have gotten fuzzy for me um by this point but that's cool um so the company um is called screencastify um they make a like screen recording application um and um the uh like the was um the kind of early days of a version two which would um have like be a you know video hosting and editing service um whereas before it had been just kind of a screen recorder and it was saved to whatever storage you happen to have handy um and that was the whole thing um so this stack um was uh lots of typescript um with uh um and all running in like gcp um and containers so the um like the main back end was a typescript um I think nextjs I forget some typescript um backend server um running in uh um Google Cloud run um this sort of like serverless containers um product that they have um and um that everything is serverless will or many things are serverless will be relevant um and then there was also um and so like that back end handled all of the uh like you know routine um you know we're hosting a web service um kind of stuff like account management and billing and Etc um and also some on demand video um en coding um and then there was um what we called the uh task system I think or job system um something like that um which was um like that ran in kubernetes um and it was um you know a bunch of um you know kubernetes uh microservices that would uh um you know respond to um videos being uploaded and um edited and things um to do um you know video transcoding and processing work on that stuff um and um that all um was powered by a bulm Q uh um a bulm q message Q um job Q um whatever and um yeah and I don't know otherwise ran fairly self-contained all right all right and and what was your role then um at this company um I joined as um the kind of like devops lead um it was like my uh like a lot of what I did there was to kind of Drive devops practices and um then also like do the um chopwood carry water parts of devops um so a lot of uh working on um the like cicd pipelines um a lot of workon observability um and uh internal tooling and um developer experience and things you know everything that um wasn't primarily focused on like building a feature in the application um was probably something that came across my keyboard at some point cool so that's a that's a lot of hats to wear then yeah awesome um okay so now you mentioned observability and we are here so tell us um tell us to what extent like when did you realize or or actually let's take a step back um did the company um see a need a big enough need for observability like had they seen that already when you had joined um yes somewhat I think um like I think that they you know they had encountered the concept um and they had you know made a start at like trying to do some observability things um you know there were definitely some people who like recognized that it was a good idea um and like nobody was fighting them about it um but they didn't I think they didn't really know what they should expect out of it um and so they'd kind of like done some like scattered starts at it and um instrumented some things um and but like you know some things in isolation and it wasn't in a very useful way um and so um you know when I got there there was uh like they had tracing um but uh like you know very disconnected um and um not really the things that people were interested in um and so a lot of like anything that anybody actually needed to get out of it um before I took that on um came from logs okay okay so then um you entered into the picture um and what was at that point when you started like implementing um or making making the systems more observable like what what was sort of your your um motivation for that um so my motivation like throughout for um making this system more observable was that I wanted to better understand what it was doing um because you know like one of the like one of the hats I was wearing was like Sr um and I needed to support these things um and that's basically impossible to do if you don't know like what it is or what it's doing um and certainly not you know like how it's behaving um and so um like after you know like after a little while um I grew very uncomfortable not having like that understanding of the system um and decided to just start like you know kind of remove the um false start instrumentations that um were already there and start instrumenting things more consistently so you actually went into the application code and started instrumenting things um somewhat um so mostly what I did was um like remove the auto instrument that were already there um from like there were I don't know data dogs like proprietary ones um and uh I'm sure they would work if they worked but they didn't actually Auto instrument several of the libraries we were using and so it wasn't helpful for us um and so I replaced those with um open elemetry auto instrumentations um which did have Auto instrument for all of the things we wanted um and suddenly like my flame flame graphs filled out and I could see what was going on from um start to finish more or less and that was exactly what I've been looking for magic um and and how was uh like how was your learning curve with with in terms of an in terms of open Telemetry is it something that you were famili familiar with initially or is that something that you had to teach yourself um so yeah I mean I was familiar with it like conceptually initially um I I don't know like back when I was on Twitter um I spent a lot of time talking to you know observability and resilience folks on Twitter um and um so you know like the um like the goals and the concepts and everything was all very um like very familiar to me by that point but then the actual mechanics of like how do you like turn on and start using open Telemetry um was not something i' had done before and so like was that did that end up end up being like a single-handed effort on your part like did you have anyone from your team assisting um yeah like I didn't I really did not want to be like the only person who knew what it was doing or how it was working um and so like I did do the initial setup myself but then like I made a point to kind of stop there and um like and like distribute followup work um from that to the rest of the devops team um at least so that you know there would be other people who knew what was going on and um knew what they were looking at whenever things needed detention and how was that received within your team um I mean I think that went really well um you know the um like distributed tracing is uh there's some inherent complexity to that domain and so there's um some sort of like learning and um ramp up um to get comfortable with the concepts there um and you know everybody had to go through that but I think like after having gone through that everybody was very pleased to have done it um and very happy to have it that's really great and so you know in terms of so did you would you say then that you were like starting to see um favorable results um like did or I mean you you mentioned that you know you started you yourself started seeing some favorable results like seeing the the things on the flame graphs um how would you say the the rest of your team took it and even a step further like about management How do they how did they take that did they did they see that as a benefit um I think uh you know at first management was kind of I don't know like like neutral um like neutral of positive about it um you know they like again it was a thing that they recognized um was a good thing to do but I don't think they really saw how much value it has at first um um you know but then we get to uh some stories with some incidents in them um and I think the value of it becomes a lot more obvious to them um at that point awesome and uh just uh circling back a little bit like you know you you it sounds like you did a lot of stuff around the um Auto instrumentation side of things um do you think like did this incentivize the developer of the actual application to go and do some additional work and add some like manual tracing for example um yes um like there were definitely some Engineers who were very on board with the idea of having tracing and you know wanted to um like wanted to go all in on that um and you know then there were others who didn't you know like again we're pretty neutral about it um I think you know no one was again like no one was fighting against it um a lot of it was you know like sure that seems fine you can do that um and a handful of boosters but were they okay with like going in and instrumenting themselves as well to kind of enhance um what the auto instrumentation was giving um yes I think so so like it's a little bit hard to say um because honestly um some things blew up organizationally um you know and so I like didn't uh I didn't have as much opportunity for that to actually happen as I would have liked but um people were very there were at least several people who were very like eager to have done it right right so at least it was they they at least got to like reap the rewards um of what you had at least set up right yeah which is always a good now in terms of your setup like um did you did you end up um like implementing an otel collector um they did yes um that was something that I had wanted to do um but you know so like the the company was sort of already on data dog and kind of invested in the data dog tooling ecosystem um and so moving like away from the like that proprietary stack and towards the you know open Telemetry um libraries and collector and things was a process um but you know it's one that like I had I tried to start and it continued after I left and um my understanding is that um like everything is open Telemetry there now um and I think they've even moved away from data dog to another vendor oh wow that's that's really cool to be able to like move to you know fully like vendor neutral sort of setup is is super awesome and I think especially like you had set the wheels in motion around that and that it continued even after you left yeah now how's that continued like um you know the the knowledge that you gained at your previous workplace is it something that you've been able to apply where you're at right now or uh yes and no um so right now um like I am at uh influx data um and so at influx um our like well when there's been um sort of all of the engineering attention um has been directed towards getting you know the 3.0 version of the database into um like uh to 3.0 um and uh um you know which is thing that like we have done now and that's going um pretty well um and so that you know frees up some people to think about other things again um and sort of where that intersects with observability and open Telemetry has been more about um like getting the database itself to be um a uh like a better better suited to work as a um backend for um collecting spans and Telemetry data um rather than like instrumenting our own things um with um for traces um and so we do have a lot of um we do have a lot of things that are very well instrumented um and like very uh like very very detailed instrumentation um and a lot of that is very manual um and that's done um with more of a performance um like um like with the objective of understanding performance um more than like Behavior or um sort of investigating um like errors or things like that and so um which is to say there's um like very deep small spans as opposed to like um you know wide spans which um I think are uh a little bit easier to work with if you're trying to like ask you know something weird is going on and you have no idea what um yeah yeah so you end basically like you have a slightly different goal compared to place but still using open Telemetry to achieve that goal yeah cool and um what would you say like were the most challenging aspects like given all your experience around open Telemetry what were the most challenging aspects in terms of implementing open Telemetry um in your specifically in your previous organization um yeah so like I think the most challenging um I think the most challenging was that there like had already been a like a start with a fender proprietary SDK um and so that um did a like that confused a lot of things um I had tried to like leave that in place um while I like at first and then instrument with open Telemetry but um you know then like these two libraries just started like um reporting on each other and um it made the whole um it made um traces like more confusing than they had been um without it um and so you know removing that proprietary SDK and just having the one um mechanism um for you know like in any given process for instrumentation was um you know something that I wish I had done right away um in retrospect um and I think the other thing was that um you know was in areas where like there did not already exist Auto instrumentations um so like I BQ earlier um which didn't have one um until I wrote it because I really needed it um and so um and like you know I I can say that's a challenge but also um a benefit because it like nobody else had one either um and with open Telemetry like it was a viable thing that I could go and write my own um Auto instrumentation package and um you know be able to get that for myself um with libraries that otherwise just didn't have it and how how was that experience of like writing the auto instrumentation yourself like was it a huge learning curve or was it that yeah that was a pretty substantial learning curve um and um I don't know it was a good thing that I started early because um you know then we got into some uh incidents and I really needed it um and I was able to get it you know like functional um in a relatively short time span from there so that I could start using it and actually see what was going on that's so cool and and you know you mentioned that you you uh your your fellow devops Engineers were were leveled up in the ways of otel like is that something that you help them out with like um what kind of like how is it that they gain the skills like leveled up so that they could also um you know have that knowledge of open Telemetry that you had um I mean I think the majority of that was you know just like Hands-On doing it um you know the like um again like after you know um I had set up like basically one um Auto instrumentation um and gotten that configured um and everything I like then um like I stopped there and I really did make a point to um have other people take that further um so that yeah like because I wanted them to have that experience um and then um like more broadly we did also have um like early on there there was a very strong learning culture which was one of my favorite things about that company um and so we had a like a sort of like technical book club um and we read the uh observability driven development um book for that book club and um you know I think that that was also very useful in terms of getting some a lot of people familiar with the like at least the concepts and you know what you should um sort of like clarifying expectations about what like this gets you um as you know like from an office perspective and from a engineering perspective and yeah and hopefully got them stoked too about it right um yeah I mean that it was um a very like the people who were inclined to be interested um definitely came away from that more interested nice nice it's really cool that this is a very like sort of operational driven um uh Hotel undertaking which I I guess it kind of makes sense because like when when things Break um it's always going to be more on the operational side of things and it's not necessarily the developers that are going to be the ones who are going to you know be oh why is this breaking right because by then it's like I hate to say it but less less their concern even though it is very much their concern but unfortunately I think I think our our culture is still kind of Shifting towards the not my problem because it's in production yeah it is um it is a little bit farther away um from them and like I have some sympathy for that i' spent a lot of time you know doing appdev um and um like but also only some sympathy because the whole time I was doing APD I was very frustrated by my inability to have any contact with production um and so I don't know and like that was also one of the things that I was trying to drive there like Beyond you know observability and open Telemetry was to like actually fulfill some of the promise of devops and have um you know have that not be such a bright line between the two do you think uh do you think you got closer to uh to achieving that goal I I think so yeah um one of the um and like one of the ways I did that was to like really emphasize um sort of how the tools are used um whenever um like whenever it came up um so you know like in doing incident um Retros the like um you know I made a point to ask people like what did you look at um that made you think that that was um you know the the concern um and you know like how did you execute those queries like let's actually open up the tool and um go through the UI and see how that's performed cool um I want to go back to um you know our chat earlier about like um Management's perspective on on using you know observability and I I believe you mentioned that it was kind of neutral until they're like oh this is this is useful um one of the things that I always find can be challenging in an organization is like bringing something new to management and and like you know you almost like need to need that permission from them um before before executing so is that something where you like did you ask for permission or did you end up asking for forgiveness in in that uh at that stage um so yeah like neither honestly um the way this worked out um so again like you know they had already like before I joined had whatever conversations they had about like getting better observability and like somebody I somebody signed off on doing something um and you know they started some instrumentation um and so that like that was clearly a thing that was like you know that was okay um so like um I didn't need to pitch them on having it um and like you know as a matter of fixing it like that was more of a um like like I don't know like a question for my fellow Engineers um like you know somebody put this in and somebody probably understands it um and I need to but like it's not you know satisfying the goals that we had for it I think and so I need to do something about that and like um but like management wasn't like wasn't going to say no to that um right because you already had some sort of an observability culture um and then in terms of like investing further in it um you know like we ran into an it um we you know launched and um a big part of this launch was or a big part of the reason for like going to the sort of 2.0 version of the product um was to enable some like account and billing um features that just weren't possible um with the way that like the um like those data schemas existed um and so like part of that and like they existed in Firebase um and they were moving to a like postgress to have you know real schemas um and that had I think some of the predictable problems um and um the migration kind of stalled out um and that was real bad um and things just stopped working for hours at a time because um the like the migration was kind of killing the um the post Chris um server without ever completing um but we didn't know that it just sort of like stopped working um and um like after some initial investigation um like instrumenting all the things to figure out what is even going on um was like the next thing and it wasn't something that I needed permission to do at that point because like you know production is down and it's going down for hours at a time um repeatedly so um it needs to be fixed um and um yeah like I don't know when the building's on fire you don't need permission to install spring clears anymore yeah absolutely absolutely so I guess at that point then even though like you were using like a different different tool set for observability and and you made the decision to like let's let's use open Telemetry Instead at that point as you said because things were not working then it became like less you know like put in put in the tool that works for us kind of thing is what it sounds like yeah um and we had already started that by the time we got to like that incident um and so like that was very fortunate because we were getting like we already had a better experience with open Telemetry like there were some parts of the system that we like could fairly well understand on what they were doing um but then like the rest of it you know that um like had not been instrumented and um so that like that had to be done quickly right so there that that's your incentive when things are burning when the house is burning open Telemetry to the rescue awesome um I think uh before I turn it over to the rest of the folks on this call um do you have any um feedback um for the open Telemetry project as a whole like good or bad in terms of like your experience um because I mean you know like we one of the one of the uh things that we do as as a group here is to um collect feedback from from users to help make the open Telemetry experience better so um um yeah I like I'm not sure that I don't know um I mean I think that like the and this was like a year and a half ago that I was doing it or whatever the like early like getting set up onboarding learning curve is pretty steep um I don't know exactly how to like how to improve that and I'm sure I'm not the first person to have said this either um I think you know like if that can be improved that would be great um also I think that like um metrics and logging you know got to like stable um since I was doing this um and it would have been really nice to have had that at the time I think um because it would be you know very convenient to have um like a consistent uh sort of like interface and um SDK for all of those Telemetry signals um and then being able to um you know like send them to a collector and then have the collector send them to wherever they're going um and um not making that like not making those things application concerns um is like would be great um I haven't had I haven't had the chance to actually do that um to see if it works or not cool thank you um does anyone else on this call have any questions for uh for Jennifer um I was just curious on the last piece you just said about having a consistent interface in the SDK for the Telemetry signals and not making them application concerns what does um I was just curious if you could elaborate a little bit more on that piece um yeah so like um so like you have open cemetry for your um like traces um and then you know like you're going to have some sort of logging solution for your logs and like hopefully you're doing structured logs um and like again some solution for metrics um assuming you're doing metrics um probably Prometheus or whatever um but like you know to get like to get those logs and those um metrics to go somewhere um you wind up having to like configure some um like vendors uh like logging Library um so that you can ship your logs to like your logging back end or um like or you log everything to the terminal or to a file or whatever and have some sort of like infrastructure magic pick it up and send it somewhere um but like and then you know Prometheus like you have to create your um scraping endpoint and let Prometheus scrape it and so you have to like have Prometheus configured and able to reach you and Etc um and um whereas like you know with spans um you like configure your exporter and you're done um and you're exporter just sends them to the collector um and um like and that can like The Collector address or whatever can come from config like after you're instrumented um you don't have to like there's not much to maintain there um and um you know like I would at the time I would really like have lik to be able to you know send my logs and my um like metrics to The Collector in the same way that I was doing with spans um rather than like having you know three solutions for three different kinds of telemetry gotcha I would see we're getting closer to that right I personally don't know I'm asking uh anyone else I think we're getting closer to it I think uh like definitely I like I think I think logs are fine like metrics are have definitely matured a lot in the last year um and I know a lot of observability backends are now ingesting metrics as well so in addition to traces which is nice um and then I think we're starting to see that with logs as well logs I know are a different Beast because there's like no um no logging SDK there's a logs Bridge um SDK so the idea is like use use one of the common logging libraries that is supported by open Telemetry and there's like a bridge um SDK for it and then it'll convert that format to OTP so then it can be ingested by whatever um whatever back end so which is kind of nice I guess they didn't want to reinvent uh reinvent wheel with logs because there's like so many yeah so many different things out there so yeah that's that's my understanding of it from my limited time playing with log so yeah yeah the which I like full sympathy to that strategy the um the momentum on the way people do logs is enormous it's not like that's not changing yeah um but how they get like collected and um organized you know you know that yeah I think the game changer is being able to correlate the logs to the traces so that you have that Fuller picture which I'm super excited about because I understand a lot of us grew up on logs but I think the traces will help tell the full story and so when you have that correlation then then you can get magic yeah I mean I think logs correlated with traces is like is the best most ideal outcome um like I know that Trac is have events and like can do point in time things but logs are just better at that like um and you know being able to see like point in time events um correlated to like where they happened within a span um and within a trace is exactly like that's what I want that's yeah yeah the dream yeah um anyone else have any other comments questions for Jennifer shall we break early then cool awesome well thank you Jennifer for sharing your story with us I think it I I really love love the story because I think it's the things are broken need observability so um I think it's such a compelling case for anybody who's like on the fence on whether or not it's a worthwhile investment um and it's it's awesome that your your company already kind of had its foot in the door um for that and and that you were able to kind of take it further to where it actually needed to be so that it was useful to uh to you and your team for troubleshooting so um I I think it's I think it's a great story I hope others will draw inspiration from that as well um as a compelling reason as to why observability with open Telemetry is a good combination um do we have I think we've got some upcoming events yeah on December the 7th we have another Q&A um with uh someone from Hashi Corp who has attempted many times to instrument Nomad so that'll be uh um I think that'll be a really interesting story as well so anyone who is following along stay tuned for that Q&A hopefully we'll get to see you live but if not we will see you on YouTube sounds good it was great to meet you all yeah thanks so much Jennifer and we'll let you know once the video is posted cool yeah um yeah I was gonna say thank you Jennifer for your story that's like really really inspiring because I feel like so many people want to always adopt it but then getting that buying from your leadership is always the problem I mean technically like it's not making their money until you sure that this is like causing problems and then we really need to do this yeah um yeah I don't know I don't know why like it's weird that it's such a fight so much of the time um because problems are going to happen and yeah like what this gets you is being able to point at where the problem is happening and I don't know why people don't want to be able to do that right so logical in my experience it only works either in teams that are excited about Progressive engineering practices or that are feeling so much pain from vendor lock in that they're ready to set everything on fire yes yes so true so basically means you need like a really nasty incident or or like really bad vendor lock in as your compelling reason well if you get that incident don't let it go to waste yeah totally right quote of the [Laughter] day awesome well thank you [Music] everyone
