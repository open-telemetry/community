# Embrace Q&A Session Transcript

[Music]

Welcome to the Embrace Q&A session! We have some folks from Embrace here, so let’s get started. 

**Introduction**

- **Elli**: My name is Elli, and I lead product for our data collection and ingestion team at Embrace. My team is responsible for a suite of mobile SDKs across iOS, Android, Unity, Flutter, and React Native.
  
- **Austin Emmans**: I’m Austin Emmans, a developer on the iOS team. I lead part of the iOS SDK development and collaborate with other teams regarding OpenTelemetry.

**What Does Embrace Do?**

Elli: We are a mobile observability company that provides developers with SDKs to monitor performance in real time. Our main goal is to help developers keep their apps running smoothly by proactively identifying and resolving issues, ultimately improving the user experience. We are heavily invested in OpenTelemetry, and we began that transition about nine months ago, which has allowed us to provide our customers with a more unified view of app performance—everything from client-side events on the user's mobile device to the backend services powering those experiences.

We open-sourced all of our SDKs, and we encourage everyone to check them out in our GitHub repo, play around with them, and provide feedback.

Austin: It's cool that as a mobile observability company, we're essentially dogfooding by using OpenTelemetry. It’s exciting that we didn’t start in that direction but moved toward it.

**Technical Architecture**

Elli: Can you describe the architecture that Embrace uses, including the programming languages and deployment environment?

Austin: Sure! On the iOS side, we rewrote the SDK with a Swift-first approach, employing a Swift Package Manager project structure. The Android SDK takes a Kotlin-first approach, but it still has a lot of existing Java code to maintain familiarity for those transitioning from Java. Our backend follows a standard microservice architecture, deploying using Argo CD and primarily running in a Kubernetes cluster. We also utilize different data stores like ClickHouse and Cassandra, with the backend code primarily written in Go, supplemented by some Python.

**OpenTelemetry Integration**

Elli: I’m excited to hear about your OpenTelemetry integration. How did you learn about OpenTelemetry, and why did you decide to integrate it into your product?

Austin: About five or six years ago, there were various open standards leading to OpenTelemetry, most notably OpenCensus and OpenTracing. When those combined, we saw the community rally around OpenTelemetry as the standard for modern observability practices. We decided to adopt OpenTelemetry because it aligned perfectly with our vision of modernizing observability through open standards. It provides a transparent and flexible way to collect data, essential for creating a unified observability framework.

Conversations with customers revealed that one of the biggest challenges was integrating insights from user-facing web and mobile applications into their overall observability practices. In an ideal world, frontend teams would collect data on user experience while backend teams would monitor infrastructure health. However, companies often use separate tools that don’t share a common telemetry framework, which is counterproductive.

We wanted to solve this problem by collaborating with the OpenTelemetry community, focusing on mobile observability. Our goal is to provide developers with a comprehensive view of their app's performance.

**SDKs and Core Products**

Elli: Do you have OpenTelemetry integrated into your core product as well?

Austin: Yes, our SDKs are our core product. We also have a frontend dashboard. One of the features is called Data Destinations, where we collect metrics in our backend and export them as OpenTelemetry signals. This allows users not using the SDK to send data to us and receive signals from our backend to integrate with other providers.

**Telemetry Interaction**

Elli: How do you interact with the telemetry coming from applications and services in your organization?

Austin: We have internal dashboards, including our own Grafana instance. Our DevOps team runs reports and monitors standard metrics like uptime, response times, and throughput. As an SDK developer, I can pull reports and generate visualizations to analyze how our customers use the product, which helps us improve documentation and identify areas for support.

**Observability and User Interaction**

Elli: It’s fascinating how observability aids not just in troubleshooting but also in understanding user interactions with the system.

Austin: Absolutely! Observability can provide insights into user behavior, which is often overlooked in discussions about performance.

**Challenges with OpenTelemetry Integration**

Elli: When you first implemented OpenTelemetry in your SDKs, what challenges did you encounter?

Austin: It was a process to integrate OpenTelemetry, primarily due to the uncertainty of bringing in a new dependency. We faced some resistance from the team regarding whether this was a dependency we wanted to manage. We had to ensure that it fit our expectations, test edge cases, and verify performance.

Another challenge was recognizing prior art and adhering to existing semantic conventions. Ensuring our instrumentation aligned with OpenTelemetry standards required thorough discussions and careful consideration.

**Rewrites and Modernization**

Elli: Did you update your existing SDK or completely rewrite it?

Austin: For the iOS team, we seized the opportunity to rewrite it in Swift, moving away from the previous Objective-C SDK. The Android team maintained their core codebase while modernizing the architecture to incorporate OpenTelemetry.

**Advantages of Embrace SDKs**

Elli: Why should developers choose Embrace SDKs over existing OpenTelemetry SDKs tailored for mobile?

Austin: Our SDKs simplify the integration process, managing a lot of the setup and minimizing the overhead for developers. We also provide mobile-specific instrumentation, automating aspects that developers wouldn’t have to worry about. If we create useful instrumentation, we aim to contribute that back upstream to benefit the community.

**Benefits of OpenTelemetry**

Elli: What benefits have you seen since switching to OpenTelemetry?

Austin: The main benefit has been the establishment of a common language, making discussions about telemetry concepts much easier. This has helped break down silos internally, allowing us to focus on the insights we provide to customers.

**Engagement with the Community**

Elli: Austin, can you share your involvement with the OpenTelemetry community?

Austin: I started attending the client-side SIG meetings about five or six months ago. I volunteered to represent the iOS perspective, and it has been a great experience to share ideas and collaborate on proposals.

**Resources for Learning OpenTelemetry**

Paige Cruz: What learning resources do you recommend for someone looking to learn OpenTelemetry?

Elli: The "Learning OpenTelemetry" book by Ted Young and Austin Parker is required reading at Embrace. We’ve started a book club around it to help everyone in the company understand observability concepts.

Austin: Visual representations of traces were particularly enlightening for me. Seeing my code in action made the concepts more tangible.

**Challenges in Mobile Observability**

Austin: The biggest challenge in mobile observability is the chaotic environment—app developers do not control external factors like battery life or network status. We need to handle these variables and ensure performance remains optimal.

**Wrap-Up**

Elli: Thank you, Austin, for sharing your insights, and thanks to everyone who joined us today.

## Raw YouTube Transcript

[Music] welcome to otel Q&A we've got folks from Embrace here so um I guess let's uh why don't you introduce yourselves uh I guess I can start my name is Elli I lead product for our data collection and ingestion team here at Embrace uh my team is responsible for a suite of mobile sdks so across iOS Android Unity flutter and react native uh and I'm Austin emmans I'm uh developer on the iOS team or uh you know the leads part of the iOS SDK development um and you know talks to the other teams just about open Telemetry in general but uh my main focus is is Apple platforms awesome and can uh can one of you tell us uh like what what does embrace do yeah totally um so we are a mobile observability company um we provide developers with sdks that integrate into their mobile apps to monitor performance in real time um our main goal is to help developers keep their apps running smoothly by proactively identifying and resolving issues uh really with the objective of improving the overall uh user experience we're heavily invested in open Telemetry which I know we'll kind of dig into a little bit later uh but we began that transition about nine months ago and it's really helped us provide our customers with a more unified comprehensive view of app performance from what's Happening client side on the user's mobile device all the way to um the backend services that power those experiences and so by doing that we really enabled develop to understand the full impact of any issues and optimize uh their apps more effectively we've op sourced all of our sdks that I talked about earlier and we would encourage everyone to go check those out in our GitHub repo um play around with them and we'd love feedback awesome and it's really cool that you know as a mobile observability company you are basically dog fooding I guess uh by by using open Telemetry and it's cool that it sounds like you didn't start in that direction but you moved in that direction and I can't wait to dig into that a little bit uh more um before we get into that um can uh can you describe the architecture um that Embrace uses and any like any of the programming languages that are being used like deployment environment like what's your Tech landscape look like uh I could take that one so um being a SD I I focus mostly on on the iOS side of things um and as we took on this journey we uh kind of rewrote the the iOS SDK with a Swift first approach and that that takes on um you know a swift package manager project structure um the Android side is similar it takes on the cotlin first approach um there's a lot of existing Java in that in that SDK and and they um do a really good job at making sure that the interface on the Android side kind of if you're a cin developer you should be familiar with it if you're coming from calling in from a Java uh a piece of java code then then that interface should feel like Java there as well um and that's you know the sdks our backend though um it's standard microservice architecture um we deploy using Argo CD and um primarily run in kubernetes cluster um and then we have a couple of different data stores depending on um how we're accessing the data that include uh click house and Cassandra um and then the the code for the back end is mostly go um with some python you know sprinkled sprinkled in here and there cool awesome and then and and now that uh we've got some of the background I'm I'm really excited to hear about um your open Telemetry integration so first off how did you learn about open Telemetry and then why did you decide to like integrate open Telemetry into the product yeah um so I think as like recently as five six years ago there's Pro there's a variety of Open Standards that kind of led to otel I think most notably open census and open tracing and once those combined into open Telemetry um we just saw the community really coales around that as the standard for modern observability practices and it really um and we decided to use open Telemetry because that fit perfectly with our vision of modernizing observability through Open Standards so open Telemetry providing a transparent portable flexible way to collect data we felt was really essential for creating a unified observability framework that ties both the front end and the back end um of applications um as we were talking to customers we kept hearing that one of the biggest challenges that sres and developer teams consistently faced was marrying uh insights from their user-facing web and mobile applications to into their observability practice all up um and so I think in an Ideal World your front end teams are collecting data about what's happening uh on to the end user the health of your end user experiences and your backend teams are collecting data about the uh health of infrastructure and services and today it's common for those to be entirely separate tools they don't share a common set of tele Telemetry aren't interoperable and really prevent engineering teams from speaking the same language um and companies really want to work on what matters most and it requires understanding where to invest their engineering resources to deliver the best user experiences and so we really saw that as an opportunity um we wanted to help solve that challenge by collaborating with the open Telemetry Community to drive the future of Open Standards for observability specifically within our expertise of mobile um and our goal is to provide developers with a comprehensive view of their apps performance so today we collect the full Technical and behavioral details of every user session with our open Telemetry compatible sdks and users can even extend that instrumentation to any custom library in their app using open Telemetry signals and then leverage our platform to contextualize the added instrumentation and because we're using open Telemetry at the core of our sdks they can easily integrate with any back end of their choice or other observability tools really giving users of our sdks more flexibility to help them avoid being to one vendor now of course we think our product as some pretty cool stuff for uh mobile development teams in terms of workflow and helping them understand data and resolve things quickly but really we think you know contributing to the community and helping mobile engineering teams modernized and helping Sr and devops teams be able to take that data and make sense of it as part of their entire system will ultimately Empower them to build better more resilient mobile apps now as as a followup question um so you mentioned that you have like open Telemetry built into to your sdks do you have open Telemetry built into your core product as well we uh so I would say the sdks are our core product that that are customers use we also have a frontend dashboard yeah so front end yeah front end is what I'm thinking of yeah um I don't know Austin can you speak to that I'm more involved side um the are some like features that we have like uh it's called Data destinations where we would collect metrics um or some of the metrics that we aggregate in our backend we then export as open Telemetry signals um and so if you're not using the SDK and exporting the open Telemetry signals directly from you know a user's device um you might be sending data to us and then getting signals sent from from our back end to uh you know wherever you configure what whatever other provider you might be using uh to hopefully get the mobile data and your backend data uh you know in the same place gotcha gotcha and um similar on a similar vein like how do you interact with the Telemetry that's coming from the from the applications and services in in your organization yeah so we have a um a bunch of internal dashboards uh and so we host our own grafana instance um and can you know run reports um monitor the standard things that you would on a on a back end uptime um you know response times throughput um and we have all of that uh you know our our devops team and backend teams have those monitors and then me as a front- end developer um and kind of uh or front end an SDK developer um looking at how our customers use the product um I I can pull reports and generate my own visualizations just to see you know is this feature being used um how is it being used how how dirty is this data if they're if they're you know adding custom properties to um their Telemetry then um is that you know are they using it in in quote unquote the correct way or the the way we'd expect um and uh that is really insightful just in terms of okay what documentation do we need to provide how should we help people um because uh sometimes if if you're not looking at this data then then you're kind of at a loss or you're just guessing um and so yeah for internal visibility it's it's mostly internal grafana dashboards um and and running our own custom queries against those um awesome and you know you touched upon something that's so interesting and that we don't hear too much about in the context of observability which is because we always think like observability helps us with troubleshooting but observability also has that added benefit of like understanding how users interact with the system and it's really really cool that um that is one of the things that that you're doing with the with the Telemetry data that you're Gathering so I wanted to call that out because I think that's very interesting and it's not very often talked about um all right well um on to some meteor stuff um when when you first decided to implement open Telemetry in your SDK um what were some of the challenges that you encountered um yeah I mean it was a process not that we really had to convince ourselves I think there was a a big upwell and a big push um but just just from a software point of view it's tough to bring in a dependency to a project um because it's there it's an unknown um at that point in time we we were un pretty unfamiliar with the open Telemetry Swift SDK itself um in that package and so you have to bring it in and and there was some push back on the team on is this a dependency that we want to manage um we had to do our due diligence and some very tedious work to make sure that it fit how we expected it to um make sure that any edge cases that we could think of uh we could test and verify that it it would work how we expected it to and then also make sure that the performance um you know matched the the scale that we were expecting um and so that's just very tedious work especially when you're compressing it into some deadlines um but that's that's not really open Telemetry specific that's just software and dependencies uh in general so a a challenge that was probably more specific to open telem and open and and observability is their um you know our first instinct is when we instrument something okay let's go instrument and and get it done um and you kind of have to catch yourself and say oh there's actually some prior art here and so let's go search for these um and so you know open cemetry has the specification and the shape of the data model and what it should be and then on top of that there are all these existing semantic conventions on how to use something and how to fit into a system and you know when you record a span that's a network request what attributes you should use for that Network request where the URL goes um what the name of that span is and so you know because we are you know Allin we want to make sure we adhere to those um to to those semantic conventions and and it's tough when there's something very similar to what you're instrumenting uh and you kind of have have to have the discussions okay is this something new is this the same should we leverage some of that and and massage it a little bit to fit our our needs um and that's also just kind of a a you know a tedious process to to make sure that uh you're not stepping on any toes but you're innovating and you're you're ultimately getting what you need done yeah and in in so when you when you did this was it like were you um just updating your existing SDK or was this like a complete rewrite when you made this decision to use open Telemetry um so for the iOS team um we we took the opportunity to rewrite into Swift um and so we had an existing SDK observability SDK that was mostly Objective C um and being a larger shift we were able to take this opportunity to really modernize it um and and you know present it to Apple developers in the year 2024 our our Android team um their SDK was uh a little younger if if that's a term you can use for SDK but um uh they were able to just maintain that that same you know the core code base and then start shifting uh just the data model piece and and I think they also took the opportunity to to modernize a lot of the architecture because um you know it changes a bunch when you're pulling in uh something like the open Telemetry St K and uh there's a lot of Concepts in there that are very useful that uh you know you either massage to to fit or you just completely real place um and so it it it was different for each platform but uh but yeah cool now some I'm sure some folks who are listening in or who will listen to this in the future might be wondering also like you know open Telemetry does have already some sdks tailored for mobile so why uh what's what's the advantage of of using like the Embrace sdks in in that case yeah it's it's really just to to simplify um we use the sdks uh as dependencies they underly like what we do and and we're trying to add a layer on top of that um to either make it a little more accessible you know we manage a lot of the setup process for uh the SDK uh and try to simplify and streamline that but then we also just try to minimize the the overhead the mental overhead of okay when I'm creating a span what do I need to do and and hopefully that's one simple call in into irdk instead of you know getting your a tracer provider building a tracer from that taking that um and creating a span Builder and then and then once you have that span so there's there's a couple of steps that the the sdks themselves have and that's part of the spec and and there's good separation there's reason for that separation um but we want to streamline that and then that's just you know if you're manually instrumenting things we also want to add our own instrumentation that is mobile specific um that is the space that we're we're really in and and we are experts of and so when you're on an iOS device there are things that occur there that is very specific to the iOS system or just users of that application um that doesn't really apply to a backend system uh and so we want to make sure that we can automate that instrumentation um so that the users uh you know don't need to reimplement that or uh don't need to worry about it and there's definitely a push for us to if we create that instrumentation to get it Upstream um because the goal is it benefits the community and then it's kind of off our maintenance burden um and so I mentioned there were two layers of the spec and those semantic conventions the Third on top of that is the Embrace semantic conventions that we're hopefully keeping as as thin as possible and we're pushing down into those otel semantic conventions when when we do create or think of new things that's awesome so basically like your SDK serve as a rapper but then also like any any sort of things that you you come up with that would benefit the community then you you uh contribute them back Upstream which is very cool and I I think you know that really speaks to the power of community because I think open Telemetry success is is due to the fact that we have so much support from from various vendors who have all decided no we're not going to like try to do our own thing and and work on an island we're going to collaborate so I think I I really want to emphasize that stuff like this is is extremely beneficial to the community um now you know when when you switched your sdks to using open Telemetry what kind of benefits did you uh did you start seeing as a uh for me it was the common language and um it became very easy to discuss um with people what open Telemetry is using you know a trace a span uh a log and what those you know glossery items are uh and one thing that uh really bugged me before is pretty much every vendor models these Concepts but calls them kind of things um and we you know were doing that before too with so we're at fault as well um and so being able to use just the common envelope and uh a common language that was a massive benefit when we started switching to open Telemetry just you know at the non-technical level um can I can I add one thing to that I think uh from like an organizational perspective it also helped to break down some silos for us internally in that even across our sdks across the different platforms prior to open Telemetry our Swift SDK our Android SDK react native Unity Etc we're all kind of built with specific uh implementation details for those platforms in mind and so kind of lived a little bit in a silo but when you think about our customers a customer of ours that has an iOS or an Android app they don't they build it specific to those platforms but in terms of performance their mobile teams want to understand that a consumer is having a great experience regardless of whether they're on an iOS device or an Android device and I think building the underlying sdks in silos internally um or I should say the other way when we move to open Telemetry being able to use those common signals helped us break down those silos such that we could really focus on the insights that we're giving um to our customers which is really the ultimate value that that we aim to provide that's awesome yeah that's a really great point um now I want to switch gears a little bit and because you know um Austin you mentioned that uh there you make some contributions Upstream um for the um to the client side Telemetry say what uh so you know tell us about uh your involvement with with that Sig and how how did you start getting involved with that Sig as well yeah um so I started attending the client side Sig um probably five or six months months ago um right at the beginning of 2024 uh my coworker Hansen was had been joining those before me and and um uh I had been joining the otel Swift Sig uh meetings before that as well and and somebody just popped their head into the a swift Sig meeting and just said hey we have this client side Sig there's not really any iOS representation would somebody please like volunteer to come hang out with us uh and I volunteered and um they' been part of that that Sig since um and joining every every week um and it's been great I mean it's it's Community ideas are shared we talk about what's going on what proposals um are happening or or what problems people are trying to solve and um you know when the time comes it's that could just be you know unmuting yourself on this Zoom call and and sharing an idea or even just sharing well this is how it works for me um that could be going into the GitHub repos for some of the semantic conventions and just adding a comment and starting the discussion there or responding and continuing the discussion there um or could be going into those semantic convention repos and proposing um some new things and so uh Hansen has done a better job than I have but uh he's LED some semantic prevention proposals for things that are mobile specific or client side specific some things like like um a user session is as something that's a little formalized and and standardized um a little bit more than it is or uh a big thing for mobile apps is when a mobile app crashes um how do we model that as as Telemetry um and now that the events um the Standalone event kind of data model has has taken shape in the spec um there's a semantic invention around uh semantic invention proposal around modeling uh client side crashes as as an event um and so that'll be very useful because we deal with crash reporting as well at Embrace um and to formalize that and and say okay here's how other people interpret crash reports um that gives that flexibility to to send that data anywhere um and so it's it's again ridding ourselves of that vendor lock in um because it's it's burdensome when when you have it yeah that's so awesome and so when uh like in terms of like starting to attend those those otel uh meetings um did you did you start doing that when you uh when the decision was made to like start using otel internally like to move the SDK to using otel like when when when did that come about I I would say the decision was made when we started switch is like okay we're we want to take this on we want to be part of this the community um I procrastinated a little bit just because I'm a person and I I didn't actually start joining until the beginning of the year but but that's just you know the realistic approach I guess um uh and and it's tough because you don't think that you have anything to contribute um and so there's a uh impostor syndrome that happens and uh it takes a bit to rid yourself of that and I'm here to tell you rid yourself of that please join um we love hearing voices from from all types of you know people using the the the tools that that are provided and so um you know come even just come and watch you can just hang out and uh chat um and then uh if if something that comes up that that you're comfortable with then then unmute yourself and and and join the chat verbally and so um yeah that that was kind of how it came about I guess that's great and I thank you for calling that out as well specifically because I I I think it's so common um when people join open source projects like the you're right the impostor syndrome is is very real it's very scary you are being so vulnerable there and and especially when you join a group that seems to be like very well established and is it appears to be full of very intelligent people and then you start thinking oh my God am I you know am I worthy of this and and the answer as you said it's yes you are you are worthy of it um yeah everyone everyone has a contribution to make and it it can be any kind of contribution I mean you know I can't emphasize enough like so so often um I have past me has has been like you know using something from an open source project and I'll like be following whatever in the documentation and and the docs are wrong and and my first reaction is to be mad oh my God these idiots don't know what they're doing and you know what like turn that frown upside down because like what you should be doing if you if if you notice an issue in the documentation if there's a boo boo um something is wrong there's nothing that prevents you from filing a pull request to fix that documentation to prevent other people from getting frustrated from it being wrong so I mean that is the simplest thing that you can do and it makes such a huge impact so it doesn't have to necessarily be code it can be documentation and it can even it can be a minor correction so that's that's my little PSA there yeah that that was exactly our approach too so it was good like awesome we want some first issues let's go read the documentation is there anything that we can adjust or make more clear so exactly exactly yeah that's so great I I love hearing these stories and and I feel like these are the types of things that we just need to keep repeating over and over in in our community and and and tell people yes this this is a great way to contribute um you know we we talked about the benefits that you um that you you saw with um integrating open Telemetry um into your sdks what are some of the challenges um that you've seen um in open Telemetry especially like in in the in the mobile space like now now that you've you know U dipped your toes a little bit more more into that in in the community um I would say the the biggest challenge that we faced is really um you know we we this layer above the open Telemetry SDK and we are trying to streamline the process of of getting into observability and it's mostly because mobile developers just aren't familiar with this territory um they might what's interesting is a lot of developers are and there are a lot of existing tools out there that that will log events and things but um we're still trying to just flatten the learning curve uh for observability for people and so a lot of the challeng is just educating and figuring out okay what what clicks for people why is this um why is this valuable why is this useful um and then going from there and then you know educating them on how to you use our our product specifically um and so that's probably the one of the biggest non-technical challenges um the technically the the biggest challenge is that in the mobile space the environment is just chaotic it's it's something an app developer does not control um this is not a a server on in a box on some you know air conditioned shelf um that you have on Key and Lock uh it is in somebody's pocket hopefully um it could be on a nightstand you have no idea on the network status you have no idea how much battery is left on that device um or how angry that operating system is and whether or not it's just going to kill your app for who knows what reason and and so um the variability is is uh everpresent and and we need to be able to recover if any anything goes wrong so we have to handle things like okay we're trying to write Stu locally to dis so we can recover this data but there's no dis dis space What do we do um you know the battery is at 2% what do we do uh and it's just it's just a little more hectic than than you would expect or hope for if you're an app developer and and really the worst the worst thing is if if you're an app developer that's worried about performance um these things are out of your control but the user is going to blame you if if the app is not performing well and so uh if they are on 2% battery and they're you know rushing to to call a car to get to wherever they need to be um you need to make sure that they can complete that operation before the system just like okay I'm done time to sleep uh and so it's uh yeah it's just it's just crazy with with what we do yeah it's definitely a whole different ball game uh in in the mobile space compared to like the non-mobile space where where I guess it's it's a little less chaotic it's it's it feels like more unknowns in the in the mobile space that you're you're having to deal with right yeah and we're we're monitoring more than just the applications performance as well there's just how the user is interacting with with this um this application and what their behavior is is is something that you don't really have to deal with if it's you know if you are in a microservice architecture there's very consistent entry points very consistent uh exit points um in in any client side application not just mobile specific but even in a web browser um you know the user might be doing something on the page that that you just you don't know how they got there they came in with state that you didn't expect uh and so now you need to understand um you know how did you actually get to this issue I I can't reproduce it works on my machine but that's that's not an excuse can use so y yeah absolutely um now uh switching back to like you know um talking about contributing to open Telemetry um you know you you mentioned um getting getting started in in contributing um what you know now that that you've been doing it for for several months um how how has it been like you know one of the things that are um our Sig does is we want to understand what the contribution experience is for open Telemetry so we can provide that kind of feedback back to the sigs um to really um to really improve that right because if if we don't if we if if they're not aware of the feedback what what what can they do to improve so what are what are some of the some of the you know tell us the good the bad the ugly uh that's that you've experienced um with with uh you know becoming a a contributor um so it's it's good I I don't really have any bad or ugly um which uh maybe that's just me but um with joining the Swift Sig I think it was like a week or two in and these are weekly meetings so my second or third meeting um we were discussing an issue and and um nacho I think just said oh hey Austin can you take a stab and look at this um and uh I was like like o okay sure like you trust me to do that that that's that's awesome um and so that was kind of a a good like uh a sign of good faith and and confidence um and uh and then you kind of go from there it's like okay now what can I do to help out um and so some of the things that we're trying to do to help out are are push um proposals Upstream into the semantic conventions um make updates to the documentation to to try to flatten that learning curve so that you know you have specific examples on how to instrument uh you know on iOS what you know maybe what this view controller is doing or um you know making a network request with with URL session um these are very common patterns for iOS developers and um it just it makes it very easy if there's a snippet out there that you can just go grab and then and then tweak into in your application and so those are the the types of contributions that were um trying to make and and you know in terms of like feedback for the the sigs it's I don't know be be less friendly I I don't have much feedback it's um it's been great so that's awesome that that's really great to hear um and in terms of like I I know you said like it's been it's been a great experience so far do you have anything like that you'd want to uh improve that you you could see like maybe this could use a little tweak um I I don't know if it's an improvement but I It Like H finding that prior art is tough sometimes um and and mostly because you know some of these are proposals that are ongoing um a lot of things are just marked experimental and you don't know um how experimental that thing is um and and it's supposed to go I think experimental beta stable there there are two or three stages for for every proposal or or specification change and um and so making sure that those signals are are up to date um I think would be very useful and helpful as a proposal goes through the process but um you know that's just bookkeeping so it if you're joining and you're you're talking about things that's that's something that if you just ask a question someone would would help you out very quickly as well awesome awesome if I can add one thing there I think Austin Austin touches on something that took me a little bit to to kind of get used to as we started working with open Telemetry which is um it does take a bit longer than you would normally expect to get contributions accepted and move through that process like Austin is talking about but I think one thing to be aware of is that is by Design and I think when you're used to working like we're at a startup and so for us we try to make really quick decisions that concept of of oneway versus two-way doors and Implement them and see what happens and so working in a community like this it does take more consensus because we want that obviously the goal of this is to be a unified um solution that anyone can come use and and by design that means decisions take a little longer than you might be used to coming into this as someone that's new um and so I think that's just something to be aware of but but realize that that is part of what it means to create a standard that anyone can come in and use and really understand and is Thoroughly vetted so um that's something that people should probably be um aware of there yeah that's actually a really great call out and thanks for pointing that out um so we're we're finished now with the main questions uh portion so does anyone from uh from our audience have questions that they would like to ask yes Paige hello I am really curious what learning resources you would recommend if it was a particular blog or metaphor or tutorial that helped have that aha moment for you both um and then the kind of followup is any helpful metaphors is that you use for teaching your customers and kind of end users paig real quick before we answer that can can you tell us just who you are and and what your goal is yeah let me let me come on hello I'm Paige Cruz I work as a principal developer Advocate over at Kronos year um I used to be in Sr mostly focused on those beautiful backend systems the microservices running in beautiful air condition data centers and so I'm looking to learn more about mobile um I'm very interested in making sure observability is useful for everybody up and down the stack and mobile is a area that I need to brush up on and y'all are the experts so I was here to learn yeah thank you just wanted to um make sure I knew who I was talking to so appreciate that um actually it's funny that you mention blogs and books and resources it is required reading it embrace the learning open Telemetry book we literally have that oh you can't see it now but because my background but by uh Tedd young and Austin Parker um awesome we've started a book club around that at Embrace this is everyone in the company and I think it addresses particularly in mobile one of the other challenges that we face that's not technical which is um when you think about observability Concepts in open Telemetry it's been primarily focused on backend to date and so taking those Concepts and introducing them to front-end and mobile developers and mobile teams and why they're important and inand observability as a whole is a challenge so before we can even get them to start implementing our Solutions or understanding or uh or helping them understand why they're important they need to understand the fundamental concepts first and so before we can help them with that we need to understand those as well and so in our journey over the last nine months it's been various levels of Education through our entire org not just myself and Austin who are involved deeply in the sdks but our CSM teams our go to market teams our um sdrs all of them so we can all kind of speak the same language and understand the benefits of of open Telemetry not just for backend observability but for client side and mobile as well um Austin I don't know if you have other on oh and we intend a bunch of conferences too so that's great just being in the same space as people and and learning what they're going through has been super helpful yeah I I can't remember like when it flicked um but I think I'm a very visual person and a very Hands-On learner and so I think it probably the first time I saw a trace as a trace tree like a visualized out in in a timeline um I think that's when it was just like oh I this is this is my code running right now and I can see it and I can see the differences here you know if I'm comparing two that that should be identical but you know aren't because of stuff um you know that's when it was like oh okay this is this is interesting and useful awesome uh do anyone have any other questions yeah I was curious you were talk Austin I think you were talking about you know a lot of the challenges um with the mobile environment just being chaotic and you know a lot of things being out of control and um I think related to that you mentioned the data model for crash events and I was just kind of curious like what um what's going on like with all that like are you like yeah what's in development and kind of what are the current topics in that area um so I uh it was open to Elementry day this week so I didn't attend the client Sig this week uh because most people were were in person um but the latest I heard which would be as of last week um you know uh nine days ago um The Proposal is up in the GitHub repo um and uh the pr has been made I believe and we're maybe it's just in a Google doc but there's a document shared that describes a crash report as an event um the the big thing events are built on top of logs and log records Hanson's in chat he says proposal not up and PR not up yet but soon winky face so uh uh heads and nose um so yeah we we're discussing and there will be a proposal very soon um to use an event events are built on logs um but the key difference is there's event name um attribute that you can key off of and and so the value of that attribute attribute is is meant to represent kind of the schema of the log body and then I think also um the other attributes in in in that log record um and so if you start calling an event with a name you know this is a client crash um then the body can take a shape that is a little more formal um and uh what's interesting and what we're kind of working through is not all crash reports are the same um in a mobile environment um you know on on Android you have the the jvm which is you know the Java virtual machine and that runtime um then there's the native crashes below that um and those are mostly like C C++ um crash reports iOS you have Swift uh crash reports there's some C++ crash reports that are kind of weird and then we're started we we have these Hy apps react native and um uh the others that are are interesting because you actually you might get two crash reports and two stack traces uh for a single crash and and there's some weirdness there just because you know if a react native crashes it it might crash at the bridge layer um or in the JavaScript and and then it throws an exception down to the native code um and so you want to capture kind of all of this stuff and it's it's very different um and so what part of what's going into the proposal is okay how do we um how do we represent this in in a format that's consumable um but also understand that it can be very different um and when when a an otel collector receives this data um you know how should they start even trying to parse this out uh and so definitely recommend checking out the proposal as soon as it's up um sorry Hansen for putting the pressure on you but uh but uh uh we're looking forward to it because it it it's one of the biggest things that when we came into otel we we kind of asked ourselves well how are we going to represent crashes um and we we struggled with that um but uh we found a way we just kind of shove everything in as a log record right now and we're like this isn't good enough this could be better let's let's try to make this better interesting okay yeah I guess I didn't um think about you know these were things like low battery as being something that would affect my apps of course I just you know like you said stupid app and not yeah so well and low battery is one where where the systems will start throttling uh the processor so instead of a lot of mobile devices now there are these high efficiency processor cores and then the like you know the AI Crazy Fast processor cores uh and so when the system sees that the battery is getting low it's it starts throttling things and pushing things to those high efficiency uh CPUs and so um that has a downstream effect of your logic is now less performant um because it's it's either bottlenecked and waiting behind something or just the processor is slower it's just naturally not um not as quick as it would if it was you know charging or or had having a full battery interesting yeah thank you for sharing I'm sure I'll have more questions once I've processed this more but yeah this is this is good thanks for the question oh no problem well we prepare to wrap up we we will turn the tables and allow you to ask us questions okay I'm curious uh I think you know Paige Reese I think both of you are uh I think Reese your developer relations engineer page you work as an Sr to the other attendees as well I'm not sure exactly your roles but I'd be curious to what extent mobile observability has is part of your current observability practice um and how that fits in or how you marry that with your backend observability um that you have in place o yeah I mean I don't personally monitored any mobile applications um and you know I work with Adriana in the andies Sig and just you know anecdotally having heard a lot of end users being interested in this space like you know like Paige I want to learn more about it because I just don't really know much about mobile observability and I'm really interested yeah honestly I think it was um learning that Embrace existed kind of I'm like oh of course you'd want to do like observability for your mobile applications as well so that was you know honestly it wasn't until that was when I made the mental connection of like duh we should but why why w why aren't we talking about it so I I see this as an opportunity also to like really bring awareness to folks that of course you should be doing observability for your mobile apps yeah that triggers you said something earlier that I meant to that noted down for this question section what like what tactics have you found work best in that regard so for instance we have deep expertise in Mobile um we've just started working in open Telemetry just like over the last last like six to nine months and we want to bring that mobile expertise to the open Telemetry Community but I think there's a there's a thing around education from the mobile perspective that we also have to do that I think relate to a lot of the questions that we talked about today what have you guys found tactics that you guys have found to be particularly impactful in that regard whether it's something you guys have done or you've seen done um in terms of just um educating others on the kind of nuances of for us it'll be mobile but it can be whatever platform right or it could be open Telemetry or whatever um C would be interested to hear about that I would say like talks blogs um um yeah I mean apply to talk at conferences that'll bring bring awareness for sure blog posts YouTube videos get on people's podcasts um is another way to just bring that awareness yeah I don't know if uh any of the other folks have any additional thoughts for me it was really eye openening um at an org we sent all of our application data to the same observability platform and I was mostly focused on the kind of website website and I just for funsies looked at the mobile side just to see what's going on there just poking around and I saw oh my God like 90% of our requests came in through our IOS and Android apps and I was like I should just honestly ignore the website because to the business the impact was would be so much greater if we were to make these optimizations and that business observability is not always talked about inside org so really even just asking folks what's the split between um entry points from Mobile versus web that can really be a thread to start pulling on and then you also get your managers and other parts of the business like PMS um also interested and invited to the party and then last thing is at srecon this year I posted a link in the chat Isabelle gave a great talk called The Invisible front door reliability gaps in the front end and touched a bit on um mobile monitoring and how sres really need to turn I um towards this space so that's awesome thank you for sharing that that's great thanks Paige well we are almost out of time so um I thank you uh Austin and iLab for uh for joining us today this has been really great really educational and um thank you everyone who who joined us as well um see you for otel and practice [Music]
