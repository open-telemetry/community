# Panel Discussion on Writing Effective CFPs

[Applause] [Music] 

Hello everybody! Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening, depending on where you are. I'm Dan, and as part of the OpenTelemetry End User SIG, I have the absolute pleasure of hosting this panel today. We typically focus on OpenTelemetry, as the name suggests, and we host end users discussing how they adopt observability best practices across the industry. If you want to know more, you can follow the QR code on the screen to get in touch.

This time, however, we're going to be gathering tips and tricks from true veterans in the tech conference arena. We’ll discuss how to write good CFPs (Call for Proposals), what topics to choose, how to prepare for a talk, and why going through the process of applying to speak at conferences is well worth it. If you have recently applied to speak at KubeCon, Observability Day in London, or any other conference, it doesn't matter if you made it or not; I think our experts will have advice that you can take home and use in your future talks. 

We want this to be an interactive panel, so if you're watching live on YouTube or LinkedIn and have questions related to the topics we're discussing, please drop them in the chat, and I will try to incorporate them into the discussion.

## Meet the Panelists

Let’s meet our panelists! If you’re watching live, I’d love to know where you’re connecting from, so drop a comment in the chat. I’m connecting from Edinburgh, Scotland, where it’s currently 5:02 PM.

### Adriana
Hello, I’m Adriana Vela, connecting from Toronto, Canada. It’s noon here, and I work alongside Dan as one of the maintainers of the OpenTelemetry End User SIG.

### Henrik
Hi Dan, it’s a pleasure to be here! I'm Henrik Rexed, based in the sunny south of France. Even though it’s still 10-15 degrees Celsius at the moment, it’s 6:03 PM local time. I’m involved in a lot of observability topics and try to contribute to the End User SIG as well.

### Josh
Hello, thanks for having me! I’m Josh, a Developer Advocate and Product Manager involved in OpenTelemetry, connecting from Brussels, where I’m here for FUM starting on Saturday. Looking forward to that!

### Ree
Hi everyone, I’m Ree, joining from Vancouver, Washington—not to be confused with Vancouver, BC—just 10 minutes north of Portland. I work in Developer Relations at New Relic and collaborate with these lovely folks in the OpenTelemetry Community, primarily as part of the End User SIG.

## What is a CFP?

Let’s dive into our first topic. Adriana, what exactly is a CFP?

A CFP, if I got this right, stands for Call for Proposals or Call for Papers, depending on the context. It’s essentially a request for a proposal for a talk at a conference. You have an idea for a talk, and you provide details about it. The specifics can vary depending on the conference. For example, applying for SREcon involves hashing out all details ahead of time compared to KubeCon, where you can be a bit more high-level.

For me, a CFP is an opportunity to network and meet people. It’s a good excuse to reach out to a conference, and if I get accepted, I might even earn some air miles as an Air France member. 

## Finding Conferences to Speak At

So, if you're new to conferences, you might be wondering how to find the right ones to apply to. Josh, can you share your thoughts on this?

Absolutely! A great way to find conferences is to use aggregator sites where many CFPS are posted. The big ones include SessionEyes, PaperCall, and PreTalks. You can also check GitHub repositories and Airtable databases that maintain updated lists of ongoing CFPS sorted by their due dates.

When choosing conferences, I think the topic helps narrow down the initial list, but you also have to consider factors like travel distance and conference size. Speaking at a single-track conference as a first-time speaker is very different from a multi-track conference.

## Why Speak at Conferences?

Ree, what makes you want to speak at conferences?

One thing I discovered early on is that my job is so busy it can be hard to find time to learn something new. If I submit a topic and it gets accepted, it gives me the time to work on that topic. Another reason is the physical interactions and conversations that happen at conferences, which can be really enriching. Plus, I've made some great friends through this process.

Adriana, you mentioned that for you, speaking is a bit of a challenge. Can you elaborate?

Yes, speaking is a way for me to push past my discomfort. Additionally, for those of us in underrepresented groups in tech, it's important to show visibility. The more we speak, the more we empower others in similar groups to do the same.

## Overcoming Imposter Syndrome

Imposter syndrome is something many of us face. Adriana, how do you overcome that feeling of not being good enough to talk about a certain topic?

You have to force yourself past it. If you don’t do it, someone else will, so why not you? You don’t have to be the expert; you can use this as an opportunity to learn. Sometimes having a newbie's perspective can be more relatable for the audience.

Josh, do you have any thoughts on this?

Imposter syndrome never completely goes away, so you just have to push through it. Even if you're not the main contributor to a project, having a unique way of presenting your topic can still provide value to your audience.

## Choosing Topics for Your CFP

Let’s talk about how to choose topics to include in your CFP. Ree, how do you navigate this?

When I first submitted my CFP to KubeCon, OpenTelemetry was new, and I had success getting my topics accepted. However, as the space has grown, it’s become more challenging. I try to find niche aspects of OpenTelemetry that haven’t been covered extensively.

Adriana, do you have anything to add?

Yes, it’s essential to ensure that your topic is unique. AI, for instance, comes up often, and while there's nothing wrong with submitting a CFP on it, make sure your angle is different. Also, be cautious of project updates; they don’t typically get accepted unless they discuss a unique challenge.

## Audience Expectations and Depth

Ree, how do you gauge the level of depth you want to present?

Sometimes it’s tough. I consider how much background knowledge the audience might have. If the topic is newer, it may need more context, while established topics might require less.

Henrik, any thoughts?

Yes, knowing the audience is crucial. For technical conferences, you can usually expect a tech-savvy crowd, but adjusting complexity based on the specific audience is essential.

## Post-Acceptance Preparation

Now that your talk has been accepted, how do you prepare? Ree?

I recommend rehearsing as much as possible. If you can, working with a public speaking coach can be beneficial. But even watching YouTube videos on public speaking can help you improve.

Henrik, how do you prepare?

I focus on ensuring my talk fits the duration and adjust content as necessary. I like to include graphics to make the experience smoother for the audience.

## Handling Rejections

It’s normal to get rejected. Josh, how do you manage expectations?

It’s common to expect a 10% acceptance rate. If you want to speak at one conference, you might need to submit ten proposals. Rejections happen even to experienced speakers, so it’s vital to ask for feedback and resubmit your proposal.

## Horror Stories

Finally, let’s share a few horror stories from conferences. Ree, do you want to go first?

In my first talk about tail sampling with a live demo, everything worked before I went on stage, but it failed during the presentation. I still don’t know why!

Henrik, any horror stories?

Yes, once I experienced screen mirroring issues where my laptop wouldn’t connect to the projector. I had to skip my demo because the screen was blank, which was quite stressful.

Josh, do you have a story?

I had a talk where the audience could only see half of my slides while I could see everything. It was a lesson to never rely on notes again.

## Conclusion

Thank you all for your insights and stories! This has been an enriching discussion, and I appreciate everyone’s participation. If you have further questions, feel free to reach out to us through the CNCF Slack or the resources provided. 

Thank you all for joining, and I look forward to seeing you at a conference!

my name is Adriana Vela I am connecting from Toronto Canada it is noon here and um I work alongside Dan as one of the maintainers of the otel and user Sig thank you very much and uh Henrik hello Henrik hey pleasure to see here pleasure to be here uh so my name is Henrik rexed so look like it's written in the in the the bottom of my video uh so I'm based in south of France the beautiful sunny south of France even if it's still 10 15 degrees at the moment Celsius um and it's 603 local time in in France and uh otherwise I'm I uh I'm trying to be involved in a lot of observ topics so tag observ and I try to give a hands as well in the end user S as well thank you very much uh Josh are you there hello yes hello thanks for having me uh I'm Josh I've been a developer Advocate and product manager in all kinds of things around uh open Telemetry and uh I'm connecting from Brussels where I'm I'm here for fum uh starting on Saturday looking forward to that I like the European representation here reys and but not last but last but not least reys how's it going hi everyone I'm so excited to be here I am jining from Vancouver Washington not to be confused with Vancouver BC um right uh it's like 10 minutes north of Portland um I work in develop relations at New Relic and I also work with these lovely folks in the open solun Community um primarily as part of the Andy Sig right thanks thanks to everyone for being here right so let's start with uh the first topic the first question from from me um which is uh going to be directed to Adriana uh what is a an A cfp in the first place can you tell us more about it starting with the tough questions okay cfp if I I got this right stands for call for proposals or call for papers depending on on the context and so it's basically a request for a proposal for a talk in the context of um uh conferences where you you basically you know you have an idea for a talk and you give give the details for said talk and depending on what conference you're applying to um there the details will vary from conference to conference um for example uh if anyone's ever applied to sron um it is a song and a dance to apply to SRE con because I I feel like they they really want you to hash out all of the details of your proposal ahead of time compared to like say a cubec con where you can like be a little bit more high level so yeah that is cfp in a nutshell I don't know if anyone else wants to chime in uh for me uh cfp is the opportunity toh to be in a conference to meet people to network uh because at the end in my role to be able to reach out to that conference to excuse and the great excuse is to talk so for me a cfp is like oh maybe I will have some miles uh with with my air because I'm Air France member if I'm accepted that would be great yeah nice okay so uh we'll move to the next one I think uh you know if you're like new to conferences you're probably thinking okay so how do I find conferences to talk to uh to talk at so um Josh can you tell us a bit more about how you go about like finding what conferences you want to to apply to speak at yeah absolutely so um a really good way is that is to use the aggregator sites that a lot of the conferences will post their cfps on so that would be I think the two big ones would be session eyes and paper call and then um what's the third one anyone can help me out with the name of that third one that oh pre-t talks pre- talks is the third one um so yeah you can you can kind of check out um those or skedge right um those are not necessarily going to be specific to the the area that you want to speak at right of course for the cncf you can look at all the cncf events that's going to be relevant for open topics um there are also a lot of aggregators I think we can maybe add some of those to this to this resources list after this is is done but um yeah there there are some GitHub repos and some like air table databases that are maintained fairly well that just sort of keep an up-to-date list of all of the ongoing cfps sorted by their due dates nice um and then from those like do you normally choose by like the topic of the conference or or do you just I mean I I rather like have everyone talk about open Telemetry all the time everywhere in every conference like is that is that something that you do normally or like what how do you choose then you know what conference for a do you normally choose a specific topic of a conference um sometimes it's I think uh the topic helps narrow down the initial list and then from there uh oh maybe Henrik has something to say on this no no no I'm changing the the display that's uh um I forget what I was saying about that oh yeah so right so the topic I think Narrows down the list but especially if like if your topic is as broad as devops or even observability that's not going to narrow it down that much there are still a lot of conferences so then you have to pick like where am I okay to travel do I like to travel far like Henrik and rack up those miles or do I want to maybe get my start somewhere that I can drive to and I don't have to get a hotel um right and um how big will the conference be I think there's a really big difference between speaking at a single track conference as a first-time Speaker versus speaking at a multirack conference I think we'll maybe get into that and some of the other questions but yeah I think just the topic alone is not an enough narrow Town nice that's cool all right so we've thought we found the conference and we've got some resources there that people can go and check out to to find where to speak and I guess you know a question for re um what makes you want to speak what why do you why do you apply to speak at conferences you know um what so one thing that I kind of found out early on was um because my job is so busy that it sometimes can be hard to find time to learn something new or you know something maybe more Niche and so if I can submit a topic and it gets accepted on something that I want to learn more about then that automatically gives me the time and bandwidth to work on that topic and learn about it so that's one reason and now that I've been doing it a while while um just the benefits from the physical interactions of being able to be in the same space as people who want to learn about these things and having um conversations about it one I'm able to learn more and then also there's a lot of other people that also want to learn the same thing you know that I wanted to learn and so it just becomes like this um really cool Collective I guess and you get to meet a lot of cool people that way too and you know not just like for professional networking but also like some have become like personal friends it's it's just really great it's a great Community like exposure to community yeah is like um is that networking aspect as well not sure if Adriana for example do you wanna yeah I was gonna say um sometimes you know like uh for me personally like speaking is almost like a challenge I I like I love speaking in front of audiences but I also find it a little bit uh terrifying in so this is this kind of like forces me to get past um that discomfort um but another thing that I wanted to point out um on like why to speak um especially for those of us who are in an un under represented group in Tech I think the more of us in underrepresented groups that go out and do talks the more we can show those folks in underrepresented groups that we exist and we can Empower them to go out and speak as well and I think that's so so important 100% uh just to add as well I think um all of us um we we all working in in technical environments and sometimes we say we we think that what we are working on is quite normal and and nothing special but there's always some things to learn so if you if you like the community and and you want to share your work you want to share your experience you share your uh your journey to go through through being uh a completely beginners to and completely experts and the advice that you can share I think it's the best opportunity because I think sharing a talk I think it's it's May a lot of of sharing knowledge and educations to the communi I think it's it's it's an amaz amazing opportunity for for all one yeah and as well like for someone that's not like a Dev rail for example you know Josh that is working on the area like you know what how do you yeah what what motivates you for example yeah well no so I am a time devil so I get the same excuse as ree right like if I get a talk accepted that's brownie points for my boss and and it justifies my existence a little bit but for people who for people who don't have that motivation right um there's another thing that Devils actually do that's really really important right which is bring feedback back from the community so that's another thing if you're an engineer on an engineering team right like it can get a little bit insular in our bubbles and so going and talking at a conference as a chance to like kind of like kick the tires on some ideas with some people that are new people to you and and gather that feedback from the community as well yeah I think that's it as well sometimes you forget that what you're doing um it might be you know something that is ahead of a curve and you like you know you want to give back right that's that's great okay moving on let's they say that you know now basically I'm convinced that I want to talk but sometimes you know there's like I I think a lot of us suffer from imposter syndrome and you think that you're not good enough to to talk about a certain topic so I'll go back to to you Adriana how do you get how do you get past that imposter syndrome and that's s of like I don't know enough to talk about a topic I feel like you just have to force yourself past it like just force yourself to do it anyway because you know what if you don't do it someone else is going to do it so why not you right um and and I think um you know a lot of times I I think this is advice that someone gave me early on when I started applying for talks which is like you don't have to be the expert and I think ree touched on this too like you don't necessarily have to be the expert you can use this as an opportunity to force yourself to learn something about a topic or the other thing is like ah you know I have to like be the expert to be able to speak intelligently about it but like there's something to be said for having um kind of a newbie's point of view as well because you know you we are so much more relatable that way um when we talk about our experiences as newbies because there are so many people who are like you know new to things and and to to show people that you're human and you're not like some like perfect being that's up on this pedestal like I think it makes it um super relatable and and more fun too for for people to learn so yeah Adriana maybe I don't know you've gotten to this point I have not gotten to the point where I don't have a little bit of like impostor syndrome or or stage fright right like it just never goes away completely I think I'm with you yeah so yeah you really do just have to push through it because it's always there but I think I think it's uh it's the talk like you mentioned before it's the opportunity to learn and to be more expert on that side but even if you're not the uh the the maintainer the main contributor of the project or whatever topics you you decided to to present I think if you have a way of presenting that is super interesting brings a lot of entertainment and people will probably listen more to you talk to as someone who is very boring on stage uh you don't need to be the full experts it's just sharing a passion in a in a very funny way or in your way in fact and that brings value for the for for the audience that is such a good point I've seen talks where you know put subject subject matter experts who were really really knowledgeable about the subject but they weren't necessarily presenting it in the most absorbable way um for a larger audience and I've seen people who were newer to the subject you know do really creative things that for me I was able to like oh my gosh yes this makes complete sense and so I think that is a really good point you have your you know you can bring your own perspective into things and the way you like share your knowledge it will I guarantee you it will resonate with somebody in the audience yeah absolutely I will also say that this is why Ree and I have cats on our slides so you mean that you you you have uh you bought cats just for conferences or or you you had cats in the beginning oh uh so like re's cat Taco is like the most photogenic cat ever and so we just like feature her on a bunch of our slides whenever we do talks together she's a pretty short hair she's ridiculous real animal but anyways I I think we talked about go ahead yeah no go ahead I was just gonna add if the conference organizers chose your talk like right like don't be afraid to submit and then if you get chosen you got chosen they want you to talk about it more than anyone else so that is so true I think uh we talked about a bit about end users and like you know I think an open Telemetry and UPS ability for example you may think as an end user or you know people will want to know about the latest thing that maintainers have been working on in hotel or the latest thing that this particular vendor is is delivering but I think there's a lot of value from users like telling the stories as well like uh do you agree with that um Henrik for example I think you talked about that previously yeah I think uh um uh I mean having uh vendors presenting they will bring always their angle uh and I think having a user sharing their story they have always a different angle and a journey uh or an experience is always super interesting it's like a a book book where you have an adventure and you just follow the Adventure so I think it brings lots lots lots lots of value to the audience sometimes even more values to have someone like me like a devoll going on stage because I will I won't have necessarily this this experience and this journey I will I will bring uh the same topic in a different angle so I think a user has I in a real experience stock I think it's I think it's the best ones from my perspective anyone else that wants to chime in on the end user absolutely so we recently organized um the open source analytics conference at my company and um where we we participating in organizing it uh at the beginning of the process right choosing the talks we specifically separated out all the enduser talks because we didn't have enough of them and we wanted to make sure that they were well represented in the in the schedule um so we like we gave definitely gave preferential treatment to those and um you know the reason for that is for for everything that Henrik said right like it's like other people want to get these stories that they can follow along with and relate to um that don't have that that vendor spin necessarily yeah I think we got that basically from from one of our audience uh saying that yeah end users just give a different weight to that to like to what they're saying right because they are using it in production they're using it in their systems so yeah definitely okay I think we can move on to another topic which is uh the topic topic so we've got uh you know we've got an idea like we want speak to at a conference and then we how do you actually decide what topics to to go through um I guess you know like what what topics to put in that in that cfp uh and I will ask that to re so this is an interesting question um because so when I first when I submitted my very first cfp to cucon in uh it was was for cucon EU 2022 um I think open Telemetry was still pretty new as a topic at ccon at that time and um so I think for like the you know the first couple years um I was having pretty good success getting like topics my topics um selected and I've found you know um in the last year um it's been getting harder one because you know there's more people talking about it but also there's more and more things being covered um and so I think it's been interesting to kind of figure out like oh now it's time to get like really kind of Niche um I mean there's still you know a place for intro intro level talks um but I'm kind of in that space where I'm trying to figure out you know what are what are interesting um aspects and topics um related to open Telemetry and obser in general um to submit in or submit for and yeah I think Adriana you had a I did yeah I was gonna say on that same vein because yeah like as re said it's getting harder and harder especially in the observability space and then um it's interesting too because like I think some of the folks on this panel have like reviewed um cfps as well for cubec cons I've done a number of of um cfp reviews for cucon and it's interesting to see what topics come up over and over and over and I will tell y'all AI comes up a lot um and it's almost to the point where you're like oh my God not another freaking AIC cfp for the love of God and they're not unique because like here's the deal right there's nothing wrong with submitting a cfp on AI but make sure it's freaking unique at this point because a lot of the stuff that's out there it's like different permutations of the same thing and so it's really about like what what's your unique take on it and also like you know we we were talking about like end user stories I think those are still extremely useful and relevant but again after a while you start seeing a lot of the same end user stories so again when you're submitting an end user story what is special what makes you a snowflake um when when you're telling your end user story the other thing I would say is like um some some folks try to like um submit like project updates as part of like you know a cfp for for like cuon or whatever and it's like dude a project update does not automatically get you accepted like save that for you know the relevant um for the relevant uh venue uh because I think there's like special like project update sessions for example so that those are like a couple of my pet peeves I don't know if anyone anyone else wants to chime in no I agree with that right like how do you TR oh go ahead go ahead go go ahead I I I agree um how do you be trendy without being too trendy but I see um in the chat there's a thing about um people don't understand the basics of otel and Oli and REE when you were speaking about like trying to find your your Niche um does do other people call it olly or is it just me um I love it Ollie yeah yes um anyways uh maybe at cubec con right like that's true like you need to you got to have something unique and novel to bring to a cubec con conference um but outside of like our again getting outside of our bubble right like open Telemetry is still a very Niche topic and I've had my introduction to open Telemetry right like the smaller Regional conferences are clamoring for those introductory topics uh introductory talks on these you know Niche topics that are our Niche right so it doesn't feel that Niche to us um yeah and and in my case I I usually try to avoid those introduction talks because I think many people will do the same so it's just matter of uh be different or bring a different angle so then when the the people will review your talk then you get probably have an interesting angle uh that will bring value to the community in my my in my perspective I do talks that are very expensive expensive in terms of preparation because I do do love Benchmark because I think I like to have those studies where you show Numbers you show things it's like an experience and then you you show that to the to the stage because I think it's it brings another value uh because sometimes you don't show that uh in normal track and I think by having that difference uh you probably have more chance to be selected nice um I guess you know related to this I think the the introductory topics and the more in-depth topics sometimes you know when you're applying for or um to speak at a conference you don't know what level of um detail you want to go through either in the cfp or in the or in the the the Talk itself is it good to like how do you know your audience and how do you know what level of depth you you want to apply um re is that how do you normally go about it that's that I still find that tough sometimes um and and sometimes I'll you know start with like okay I kind of want to be more high level about this topic but in order for someone to have to come to this topic they might need you know XYZ knowledge and so even though it's more high level on that specific thing it might be considered like an intermediate if that makes sense um so it yeah it really depends and I'll also try to um you know consider like how much you know is this am I talking about something newer you know that was like more newly developed um so there's like less info about it or is it something that's been around for a while um so I don't I don't have like a really good answer um I I still find it tough honestly um I try to stick to like either beginner or intermediate level um in general because of the topics that I typically choose to do and the thing also it's a personal judgment as well sometimes you say oh I think it's it's beginner or I think it's it's I have no idea it's it's complicated yeah what what may seem basic to you might be very Advanced to others or the opposite right yeah yeah yeah do you have any any other tips there Josh to try to basically gauge the I have a quick anecdote so yeah it's it's hard to get it right um I gave one talk that was an introductory talk but I was trying to make it a little more advanced I thought oh this is you know this seems like a fairly technical audience I'd been having conversations with people at lunch everybody here's going to know what evf is so I didn't mention it and then the next speaker after me says raise your hand if you know what ebpf is and me and the one person I was talking to one raised our [Laughter] hand oh well awesome so yeah it's hard to get it right it's hard [Music] yeah right okay so Henrik I'm going to go back to you you um because I know that you're everywhere in open Telemetry as well so like I I know that there's a lot of Hot Topics in open Telemetry um but yes so what are the Hot Topics that you recommend people be writing about right now I know that you know doesn't have to be Hotel I know that we all love hotel but what are the what are the sort of like the Hot Topics that you would recommend thinking about writing about or talking about sorry uh I think uh what I would suggest is that but by the way AI I don't AI is not valid it is it is I think the in general the uh you you have to look at in previous conferences what has been presented and covered so far um so if you start to say I want to do open Telemetry on instrumentation there's plenty of them out there there's plenty of video out there and then there's no Hot Topic in general so usually I try to bring the the problem statement so for example how do I sample properly how do optimiz because the there is a big big in in case of observability there's a big concern about oh uh observ is going to be expensive so how can I control that cost uh so going through on that directions I think also there is another Trend that that I think is really important that people needs to be uh educated a bit more uh it's the sustainability so how can we make it green make it better so um talking about AI is not going to be green because you're going to consume more resources so maybe having another approach where you say oh you we we we we need to be good citizens of the worlds and and save energy I think that that's a pretty good one and also I think there is um anything that new projects comes in for example today uh as we speak open Telemetry profiling there is few talks out there in cucon and it's going to be more and more popular so there's a big chance that profiling will bring new problems new challenges so covering them that could be also interesting so try to follow what happens in the industry and and think about oh um if I start digging this I may have problems so how can I resolve them and maybe share that that uh that solution or that um this approach to to to a larger group to the community nice I just add Henrik Henrik you're really good at this right like you mentioned uh sampling and I saw that video right in my feed and I was like oh that's a great topic I'm gonna check that out later when I have time so uh yeah like if if henrik's talking about it he can only be one place at once right so maybe that's an interesting thing for you to put your own spin on somewhere else yeah I think so Absolut absolutely any other any other takes on you know what are the some of the some of the Hot Topics I would like to add something so uh you know I think piggybacking on what um Henrik was saying on on uh the topics of sustainability um there's some really cool like cncf projects out there um on on Tech sustainability and I I feel like this is a super hot topic um for for the year just because we're seeing a lot of stuff around like just wacky environmental things happening right like increase in forest fires bizarre temperature swings like and we're inherently in an industry that is contributing to the problem so um writing talks about um how we can use technology to less in the problem I think um can be really compelling and very timely and so there's there's a hot topic for yall for anyone considering it I would also mention you know like we talk a lot about cubec cons and I think Josh made a point earlier um about like there's a lot of conferences where like things like open Telemetry are still like kind of um you know not not super well known so um especially like a lot of these open- Source conferences like scale for example I think just added an observability track this year um fum I think would probably be another great one state of open con um another great one where you know we probably um there's probably not enough talks on observability so getting into those um sort of more nichy conferences um I think would be would be a good place to start especially if you're looking to do a talk on observability oh yeah all things open as well well Reese mentioned in in our yeah so right I'm going to take one question from the from the audience thank you so much for your questions and again you know if you've got any questions on what we're talking about drop them in the in the chat on YouTube on LinkedIn um and the question is should we go for a catchy title for a click baity title when you when you write your cfp or should you do more something more perhaps descriptive and accurate um Josh what do you think about about that do you normally go for something like that I almost always do a clickbaity title or at least I did that was always sort of my way um but I've only been doing this for a couple of years and someone who's been doing it for longer than me told me um actually it's a it's a it's a pendulum right it swings and what the conference organizers are looking for is going to swing back and forth almost like a cultural Zeitgeist and there are times where they want it to be super super specific and we're not in one of those times right now and be like maybe we're swinging in that direction but for me right now it does feel very much like the clickbaity titles are in and maybe we'll all get tired of them because of the AI topic and we'll be like no you need to tell me exactly what's in your talk so that I know that it's not a surprise ai ai talk and that'll be where we're at a year from now who knows I think um it if you can come up with a catchy title that also will give audience an idea of what to expect or like what your topic is about that is a great way to go I also do really like just clear straightforward titles as well um so I think they both have their place um and you know the content for sure is going to matter more I I say um because you could have a great catchy title and then the abstract is kind of you know maybe doesn't doesn't really fully flush out the idea um so I I I think the content is still king um but yeah title is is important as well um but as long as you have like a clear title and not necessarily like you know kind of click baity or whatever I think that's that's fine too in in when I preparing uh my talks usually I I try to bring the technical aspects and then try to find a funny angle or an analogy to a movie to video games to do whatever and then in the title I I try to bring that that fun uh friend angle because at the end uh U I think that that could be more attractive at the end because at the end when you have the schedule and you see a a title that is more I don't know sounds more fun then maybe more people will join your session for some some some reasons well I think the title is is is as as important as as the abstract from my perspective yeah and I think s go ahead go ahead oh I was going to say I I do generally agree with you on that the only thing I would caution again is a um make sure your titles don't sound like they were CH generated by chat GPT and B um make sure that your titles like aren't so pop cultur where like it ends up alienating potentially the cfp reviewers like I don't know if someone's like making a Game of Thrones reference in a talk title I'll be like I have no idea what you're talking about and I'm kind of like super put off by it um so I would just caution like it's it's a fine line to trade nice and I guess you know that's as well part of there are a couple of questions from from from YouTube which are related to to to that basically to knowing your audience right so who's going to be reading your your title your cfp so how do you know that how do you know like how to approach the the the audience in a way that they would understand or engage with and I'll ask that to Henrick it's it's a very very good question um uh usually goes to kcds and to cubec con and or open source friendly conferences so I know that the people that will be in that conference has at least tech technical background uh so then I I know that my talk would be not perceived as too technical um but yeah if you go to a conference that is more salesy uh then yes uh you may have to adjust and say okay um what are the type of persona that will be in this conference do I have the the normal audience that I'm talking to in general or should I uh reduce the complexity of my talk so then people can can follow uh the the idea behind behind this talk cool right I'm going to move on to uh to another topic which is like the post acceptance so like you got accepted hooray so what happens now what how do you train how do you rehearse what is like what can you give people to get ready for for the day I know was a very wide question so I'm going to start with h I'm going to start with ree how do you like prepare for it well so when I got my first talk so funny well funny story my very first cfp that I submitted ever was also my first one that was ever accepted which was huge and terrifying and my manager at the time she actually hired a well hired she got me a few lessons virtual lessons um with a public speaking coach and I found that that was super helpful it was just um three virtual um sessions and I came away with techniques that I still use but I also know people who you know are great speakers who don't who haven't gone through that profession training um but I say it's at least worth it to if you can if you have the resources to um I recommend it but if not there's also you know um YouTube's YouTubes YouTube videos you can watch um and of course like rehearse um as much as you can so that you feel comfortable and feels natural when you're like presenting but I'm sure other people will have their do any other topic any other like um tips or tricks to to basically get to the to the to the training rehearsing stage I uh I I usually don't I do just the rehearsal not a full fresh rehearsal I'm just checking that my talk is basically I'm respecting the duration because sometimes I put lot of content and then I realize oh maybe maybe too much here so I need to maybe figure out by timing yourself and then you know that when you will be on stage there's a big chance that you will take probably more time so I had a few minutes few minutes in a like a to to be always in time I think that's the best thing uh but what I usually do I'm trying to to put a lot of Graphics make it more nicer uh I put I mean that that's my my my style so I like to make a lot of graphics and make it more smoother experience for the audience so that's something that I prepare a lot in the background nice I'm going to take now a question from the audience and I think I'm um I think I'm GNA I'm going to choose I'm going to pick Josh to answer this question if a conference offers multiple formats for example lightning talk or a deep dive and you know I could make your talk fit more than one should I spam the organizers with multiple responses or is there a better way in my opinion that's something that will work if you know the organizer and can reach out to them directly right like or if they're having an office hours and you can talk to them about it and you can get that feedback that's fine but I do think that if you're a firsttime speaker at the conference or sort of unknown to the conference um you have to sell the talk you have to be a little bit more confident in the talk that you're proposing because they're going to be evaluating you based on the talk more than how they know you as a as a speaker see anybody else yeah I wanted to just mention something like especially um depending on the conference like some conferences don't have limits as to how many um talks you can submit um and so um sometimes you know especially if you're like a newbie speaker go for it and just see see how far you can take it um but other other conferences like Yukon where there is a limit on the number of sessions I would caution against um submitting like basically two versions of the session where it's like one's a lightning talk the other one the ones the other ones a longer form talk I think you have a you probably have a better chance of just submitting like two unique topics um because you never know also I will say um don't be afraid to recycle submissions at other conferences it doesn't always have to be a unique topic super super important it saves you a lot of like mental energy because putting together talk is a lot of work I would just add to the fact that um for the reviewers if you have a talk and usually you design your abstract for a 30 minute stock for example then the reviewer would expect some some details so then you say okay so he's GNA cover this and that makes sense in 30 minutes because it's going to be well covered and then if you then say uh if you do the same cfp in uh lightning talk then you say wow how is it going to cover that in five or 10 minutes so I think you need to adjust of course the way you're going to um present the abstracts I would definitely recommend to do like like Adana mentioned to have two different submission uh one lighter for the liting talks and one bigger for the the panel the the normal track cool okay I think it's time to start closing closing thoughts and I think one of the well not not quite there yet but one of the questions that that people normally get is I apply to you know many conferences and then you get you get rejected and uh how how normal is it to get rejected I think is it how do you manage your your expectations for getting your cfps accepted I corre yeah it's tough is it so Josh do you want to go uh give us give us your thoughts sure I think uh someone again you know getting advice from mentors is great someone uh told me on to expect a 10% acceptance rate so if you want to talk at one conference a year that means you need to submit 10 um and I I think that holds even for experienced speakers to some extent uh as well as new at least from what I've seen I don't know if you all how you feel about that ratio but you know that's interesting because I haven't actually done like a uh statistical analysis myself um but it is absolutely normal to get rejected you know you think about conferences some conferences get especially the bigger ones they get thousands sometimes um but usually like you know at least tens of dozens or hundreds of submissions um so and just because they rejected it you know this time doesn't mean that they won't next time I know people who've submitted the same one um a few times to the same conference before it got accepted so sometimes it's just timing sometimes it's just you know they just have a lot of topics that were just really really good um and sometimes too you can also ask for feedback from the from the um um conference um keepon for example they're pretty good about sharing anything um if they get feedback on your um proposal they'll they'll be happy to share it so that's something to think about too cool I I also wanted to add like it's okay to like mourn your rejection um because you know especially like when you're really invested in a topic and you you think like I've got such a great chance of getting this in and you get rejected you got like a great title and you're just yeah yeah it's like it's okay to mourn and and take that time to mourn and then as ree said like if possible ask for feedback um resubmit it um to that same conference or another conference or like in the case of cubec cons there's like so many across the globe submit it to a different cucon um you know like if didn't get in for na submit for EU there's open source Summit na there's open source Summit emia and also like take some time to reflect also on your cfp and see if there's like um areas where you see Improvement like sometimes I'll like write out a cfp and then I'll like you know it gets rejected I res submit it for another conference I'm like o yeah I can kind of see why they didn't like that and just make a few tweaks yeah agree well thank you so much I think now I've got one last question from you and I think as uh well if everyone's been following the the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards you'll see that we've got quite a lot of horror films coming up and the awards so I've got a question for you I think you've been to many conferences and I would like to hear some of the conferences that you've been to because I think we didn't cover that in the in the intro and I would like to know you know some of the some of the conferences that people could go and rewatch your videos but also like if you've got a quick anecdote or something that failed that was a bit of a Horror Story right so the mic doesn't work or you know something that doesn't work so um can you tell us about it and I'll go for re first because she's got her hands raised my very first talk that I did it was about tail sampling open Telemetry I had a live demo and everything was working I checked it right before my talk everything was working got up to the stage started the demo it didn't work um and I still don't know what it was because I got it to work a few minutes later and I know there's some people that I'm still remember that too so anyways that's my I have other ones too but that one is very um sticks close your recent uh conferences that You' talked at Ree I think so people can go and watch some of your of your talks uh um all things open I'm not sure if every one of those has recordings um but yeah those are the big ones that I I can remember off the top of my head co um Henrik do you want to go next uh has uh what was my worst experience I would say uh it happens once where I have to connect my laptop the screen mirroring didn't work and then I suddenly I did the demo and then you end up having nothing on your screen and you're like this and trying to type uh and looking at and it's like nightmare I was say okay the demo is going to be a nightmare impossible to achieve and so then I um I think the demo I I try to to skip it uh very fast uh but I was not very happy uh people didn't didn't see so much because I I I try to react as fast as possible to avoid having that blank effect where stress coming up up to you but um yeah at the end I was unhappy because I said ah my performance was just uh not normal and not acceptable so I had to improve that but yeah uh where can we see you next where can you so i w i was rejected for qcom so I've been crying uh so now I think uh I have no tears anymore so no it happens to the best it happens to the best it does uh so uh yeah the next I have a virtual conference that uh I don't know when it's it's going to happen in a few weeks I'm presenting talk and then I submitted lots of uh talks for the season so a lot of kcds and Cube con China and and Japan so we'll see didn't have the um the feedback yet so cross the fingers but otherwise if you want to watch any content from my end uh you can find it on cubec Con Europe cubec con North America and then I have plenty of other kcds where I have presented talks last year awesome Josh do you want to tell us your Horror Story yeah it's actually quite similar to henrik's it had to do with screen mirroring and not working and this is actually also like recent my very first uh talk um the audience could only see half of my slides I could see all of my slides but none of my notes um so my lesson that I took away from that is I never I never rely on my notes ever again um plus one plus one to that plus one to that yeah you have to have it all in your head you have to be able to just talk about the thing for 20 minutes with no notes and no slides if it comes down to it um I think not to scare anyone else off from doing this right like you can you can do that actually it's not as hard as it sounds um but yeah that was that was my worst Horror Story um although I would say like I feel like at least something small goes wrong pretty much every time uh and then where where you can find me right uh a lot of devop days I'm really big fan of those and I love that the the kcds are starting to sort of adopt that that Community format and sort of the open discussion format more um I really love those conferences and I love to get the combination of like the people who are are coming from all over um like you would see at the bigger conferences and then just also the local Representatives uh of the tech companies that are Employers in that area nice kcd and Edinburg yeah that is a kcd and Ed find out this this year and probably because London it's normally in London but like I guess London is getting cubec con so at least we're getting something I didn't see the cfp yet is it when is it open I it's in October so I'm not sure when the okay but yeah everyone in Edinburgh is really excited about it I mean I'm not sure the the normal person in the street would be but I am Adriana do you want to have some yeah tell us some of your horror stories um I think for we knock on wood I haven't had any like horrid things happen during talks um so I I will say that um I am not a fan of live demos and so I I do pre-recorded demos actually Ree and I have done a bunch of talks together um and and the ones that we've done together have had demos but they were pre-recorded but live narrated so that is my tip for you if you're scared of live demos like I am um I think for me the worst is like when you give a talk and you're like H that wasn't my best work and you feel like you're a little bit off like sometimes my voice is a little bit shaky or I just like kind of forget my talking points um I think that's uh you know just getting rattled by that and and and I it's interesting because um you know you come off a talk and people are like oh that was so great and you're like oh I sucked and so you kind of just have to like get over yourself um and just tell yourself like it happens um and it'll happen again and you just have to be okay with it and I would also suggest when you're practicing talks um practice like you know as you're practicing and you stumble just like power through it because that can happen in real life or you you stumble so if you if you practice that during your you know if you stumble during your practice don't like restart um see where it takes you um as far as conferences uh that I've spoken at and I'm just sending Henrik a link to my YouTube channel because I have a playlist of all my talks um but uh like I said recently I've done a bunch of talks we've spoken at cucon North America and EU a few times together we've spoken at observability day North America and EU together I've spoken at platform engineering day most recently in in North America we've done all things Reese and I have done all things open together we did umce open source Summit yeah open source North America and EU coming up and what we'll be at scale coming up yes we're going to scale in in March um we're speaking at cucon EU um yeah coming up in London um and I got in for observability day EU as well um and then I I did um I did a devop days in Montreal and most re and one of my favorites was a kcd Buu um where I got to give a keynote unfortunately there's no recording of of the keynote but I have a blog post version of the talk if anyone wants to check out my medium Channel awesome well thanks everybody so much for I mean you are really the the Dream Team so really like all the veterans from all the you know conference dos you can see that you know like from the amount of conference that you be so thank you so much for for yeah for your tips and tricks and your advice I think you know it's been really really useful um but I think that's all we had time for and uh I just want to say thanks for to the panelist thanks to the people that ask questions in the audience I think we didn't get to cover all the questions but um we are always open in the end user Sig you can come to the cncf slack you can go to the the resources that are here basically and get in touch with us I think we would love to hear more about your well in general anything about open Telemetry but also about topics like this one how do you go and talk about open Telemetry everywhere so um yeah with that that thank you very much and see you at a conference get the questions that were UN insed in the SL Channel yes right thank you bye bye bye [Music] [Applause] [Music]
