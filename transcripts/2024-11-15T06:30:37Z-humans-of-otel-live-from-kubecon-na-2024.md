# CubeCon North America 2024: OpenTelemetry Community Conversations

**Host Introduction:**
Hello, everyone! We are live from Salt Lake City. I'm Rees, and I'm here with some special guests at CubeCon North America 2024. Today, we’re going to talk with some incredible people in the OpenTelemetry community about their experiences and insights. Let’s dive in!

---

**Guest Introductions:**
Good morning, everyone! I’m Hazel, and I have a lot of thoughts—thoughts that never stop. I’m thrilled to be here and hopefully make you laugh a little. 

And I’m Adriana Vela, working with Rees on OpenTelemetry and user experience. We’re excited to talk to our amazing OpenTelemetry guests today.

---

**Hazel’s Journey into Observability:**
Hazel: My journey into observability began quite similarly to many others. I didn’t start with the intention of getting into it. I became frustrated with various issues, which led me to ask better questions about my systems. The tools I had weren't sufficient, so I started searching for better options. 

One of my superpowers is understanding entire systems intuitively. In college, I took an operating systems class where the goal was to learn to debug, but I found myself mentally tracing the code instead. While I could debug effectively, teaching others was a different story. I wanted to help people realize they already had the knowledge to find answers and learn how to ask meaningful questions.

---

**Getting Involved in OpenTelemetry:**
Interviewer: How did you get into OpenTelemetry?

Hazel: I was frustrated with the vendor-specific tools available. I wanted to find a way to unify everything, and that’s when I discovered OpenTelemetry. It felt like the core essence of observability—something we could build upon.

---

**Contributions to OpenTelemetry:**
Interviewer: How long have you been using or contributing to OpenTelemetry?

Hazel: I’ve been involved since 2019, focusing on empowering others and helping them navigate the various tools and integrations. 

Interviewer: That's impressive since 2019 was not too long ago!

Hazel: I know, right? It feels just like two weeks ago!

---

**Observability and Platform Engineering:**
Interviewer: You’re heavily involved in platform engineering—how does observability fit into that?

Hazel: Observability is critical for effective platform engineering and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). However, many people still treat it as a separate concern. The reality is that observability should be integrated into everything we do. 

I see a lot of fragmentation in how teams manage observability, often leading to reimplementations of solutions. For instance, profiling discussions often overlook existing solutions we’ve developed in OpenTelemetry.

---

**Challenges in Observability:**
Interviewer: It sounds like you encounter many challenges in the industry.

Hazel: Absolutely. The CNCF landscape is vast, and many teams end up reinventing the wheel rather than collaborating. We need to encourage communication between communities to avoid this.

---

**OpenTelemetry’s Potential:**
Interviewer: What aspects of OpenTelemetry intrigue you the most?

Hazel: I find the disconnect between the end-user experience and the operational side fascinating. There’s a lot of potential to bridge that gap and create a more cohesive understanding of how to use the tools effectively.

---

**Observability 3.0:**
Interviewer: You mentioned "Observability 3.0." Can you elaborate on that?

Hazel: Sure! Observability 3.0 is about integrating non-technical perspectives into observability. It’s about making sure that not just technical teams, but also business analysts, marketing, and sales teams understand the systems they work with. We need to connect the technology with the broader business context for a more harmonious operation.

---

**The NLY Foundation:**
Interviewer: Can you share a bit about the NLY Foundation?

Hazel: The NLY Foundation was started by Chris Nova and emerged from our experiences building a community on Mastodon. It focuses on empowering communities to own their architecture and engagement without relying on external platforms that may take control away from them.

---

**Closing Remarks:**
Rees: Thank you, Hazel, for sharing your insights and experiences! It’s been a pleasure. We’ll share your socials and how to get involved with OpenTelemetry at the end of this segment.

Now, let’s welcome our next guest, Ted!

---

**Ted’s Introduction:**
Ted: Hi everyone! I’m Ted Young, one of the co-founders of OpenTelemetry. I come from the OpenTracing side, and I’m here to discuss my role in the project.

---

**Ted’s Role and Community Building:**
Ted: As a member of the governance committee, I help find consensus on design decisions. Building trust in the community is essential. Ultimately, everyone is working toward the same goal, and it's about finding common ground.

---

**Vendor Neutrality in OpenTelemetry:**
Interviewer: How does OpenTelemetry maintain a vendor-neutral stance?

Ted: It’s crucial. We structure the project to prevent any single company from dominating the conversation. This way, we can avoid conflicts and ensure that everyone has a voice.

---

**Future of OpenTelemetry:**
Interviewer: Where do you see OpenTelemetry in five years?

Ted: I believe we’ll see more advancements in analysis tools that leverage the data we’re collecting. The focus will be on connecting signals and providing actionable insights.

---

**Final Thoughts:**
Ted: If you’re an end user, please get involved in the developer experience SIG and provide feedback on your experiences with the SDK and APIs. We’re committed to improving the user experience.

---

Rees: Thank you, Ted! We appreciate your insights. Don’t forget to participate in the OpenTelemetry survey and get involved in our community discussions. 

Thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to continuing these important conversations at CubeCon!

## Raw YouTube Transcript

well he hasn't done the countdown so YouTube oh is this on the channel y should I just shut up right so I launch the counter of 10 minutes that's too much probably drop it no we still have this oh it's otel official Hotel Dash official Happ oh he's checking the otel channel to make sure that start it's queuing up on their live okay cool perfect are you ready M yeah and I will in hello live from Salt Lake City I'm reys and I'm here with with some special guests uh we are live at cubec con North America 2024 and we're here to talk with a couple of really cool people in the open slump Community um just about how they got involved and kind of learned a little bit more about them and let's go all right good morning good morning good morning I'm really glad to be here so for those of you who don't know I am ha a weekly and I have thoughts lots of thoughts they never stop thinking and they never stopped thinking and I am super glad to be here and talk with you all and hopefully make you laugh so hard to cry a little bit thank you and I'm Adriana Vela and I work with Rees on the otel and user Sig so we're excited to be uh talking to our awesome Hotel guests today so Hazel how did you get involved in open cemetry like what is your story how did you get involved we could start at the beginning how did you get involved in observability observability so I think I got involved with observability in a very similar way that a lot of people do which is to say I didn't and what happened was I got really really frustrated at things happening and I needed to figure out how to actually ask better questions about my systems and figure out what was going on and dig into them and the tools that I had weren't very good and so I duk around looking for better tools better ways to do things and more importantly better ways to teach other people what we're doing and how it works because one of my superpowers is being able to take the entire system and hold it into my head and be able to sort of intuitively think about it like when I was in an operating systems class in college the point of the class was to kind of almost force you to learn how to to do bunker but I never never did and I still don't know how to need to do bunker because I just looked at the code and mentally traced the colel in my head and debugged panic gloss in the schuer by just like staring at it but I can't teach that to people and I can't show them how to think about that so I've always set then want okay I can I can figure this out with just you know print F debuging or whatever I want to and Vibes but how do I actually how do I take the Vibes and turn into a tool and an explanation and a technique and a way to teach people that you have this you already know the answers you know how to find things you're already like 80 or 90% in the way there it's not this magical new tool kit it's this asking questions that are meaningful to you getting those answers that are useful and then doing something useful with that like learning and then after effectively on that and you don't do that you already know how to do that and just taking that and looking for really really nice things ended up getting me into that observability space where I met a lot of people that were also trying to do that and how did you get into open Telemetry itself so open Telemetry um so for me it was actually I looked at the shape of all the different vendor specific things or the different instrumentation of like locking or metric or we didn't really have traces when I first spped and it was actually really frustrating because I really really hate doing things that are undifferentiated in a different way I would much much rather do a bit work to figure out like how how can I SWA in down how can I think about this concept of optionality and putting everything together because one of the best things about linnux is it turns out you don't need to write a kernel in order to get something working you can use one and one of the best things about kubernetes is sure you write you know your own custom flavor on top but it's the thin veneer over this core and so for observability I started looking for that core the essence of it that you could build that thin ven or that layer on top and I found that in open Telemetry that's amazing so how long have you been using the project or um yeah contributing or using the project so I've been using the project actually ionically usually not directly because I'm low enough on that platform size what I'm almost always looking to do is enable people and so I have looked at the open tary collector a lot of being able to say how can I Empower people how can I enable them how can I take them from these different places of maybe they're using one vendor here and one vendor on another team and one vendor on another team or a third party integration or the open taryle code and so as far as being able to enable people and think about that I started I want to say really really digging deep in building those platforms for other people around in [Music] 209 okay wow so basically from the beginning really yeah yeah that's great aesome um which is so weird because like 2019 was not that long ago it's like 2 weeks ago I know right it does feel like it absolutely yeah I I was going to say um you're also like um you know heavily involved in in the platform engineering space and I feel like observability is one of those things like we often talk about it as like a separate thing um but really like you can't have effective platform engineering without observability you can't have effective SRE without observability um and I know you have many thoughts yeah so it's actually something that urts me a little bit a lot of the time because I get the I get why this happens because you have a massively wide platform and you have a massively wide tool chain and people keep adding more and more context into something and the context goes deep and it goes wide and it goes up when it goes in all the different places and you can't possibly hold on your head unless you know you're weird like me and you can hold way too many things in your head and but you do end up in this situation where yeah open tary you can dive so deep into it it can become your whole thing it can become like the only thing you really think about and as when you see and a lot of companies with the platform teams they start off with aici team that's really just rebranded Ops and then they take the rebranded Ops Team they split into you know two three teams and then one of those teams ends up being in charge of you know the kubernetes part and that you know gets labeled the platform team for some reason and then the platform team gets turned into two three different teams and then you keep going on and you know someone gets stuck with the the observability thing and it ends up being really complex because it there's a lot of moving parts so I see how things get split out and by at and sort of frally fragmented you know much in the same way as the CNC of landscape is so massive everything has it own the kind of corner nobody really talks to each other but I wish people would do that because they often end up reimplementing the same thing over and over so like in the profiling side of things we have this open profiling aspect and they're looking at a lot of the open lary stuff and they're Reinventing a lot of the same discussions that they need to have a lot of saying do you need standards do you need name Advent do you need plugins how does the collector of and I'm like we solve that 5 years ago like look at the preexisting stuff tweak it a bit and then you think about it or you have the like event streaming architecture people where you have like databas streaming you have lak House people and you have business and lits and business intelligence and all these different data science types of things in data science related stuff and it turns out that if you are trying to take a metric but load of data and derive useful actionable insights from it and then share that with people who doing data science that's kind of what we decided to call it you know 20 years ago and then we forgot about that and we reinvented open Telemetry instead of making a data Pipeline and then we reinvented profil instead of making a data Pipeline and now we're kind of looking at all these things and then we're going oh oh we should do this thing and then the you know the powerbi or the business analytics people in the corner are just crying a little bit because they've been doing this since the ' 80s and then way over here in the financial side uh did you know this is one of my favorite things actually so kdb is a financial analytic statem database and it is a colon database and so if you look at high frequency trading or you know data analytics people that are specialize in the financial World they actually predate the usage of all of these like oh no queries that rely on indices you can just grab the DAT s and they've been doing that for 40 years CU they had to and nobody else ever really thought to look it up and so it's it's it's fun to see all the communities reinvent things over and over bring their own favor and context into it and then hopefully we can with platform engineering start stirring all the people together talking to them and getting them to actually look outside the little window and go oh we solve the same problem well that's cool how can I learn from how you approached it and how can you learn from how I approached it and can we build kind of a more common thing that's like really awesome given that there's so many you know interesting points that you just brought up and like the way your brain works and how you can look at something and kind of intuitively understand what's happening what pieces of of uh the projects open projects are intriguing you so one of the things that's really intriguing to me about the open telary project is rather it's intriguing to me because I want more people to care about it and that is actually you have this dichotomy of open telary as the end user kind of Part F where you have this SDK and this API and there's how you use it and and you have this mental model and then you have the operational side of how you collect the data how you store it how you enrich it how you sample and how you do all these things and they're all deeply disconnected and they really don't need to be but the reason they're often deeply disconnected because they're all non intentionally or maliciously horrifically lying to each other so the mental model for example that you have with traces is oh there's like this little box and it's this start of it and the end of it and in the Box I put all my information stuff and I draw some information on the outside of it and then in the information stuff I had another box then I have another Bo and I have another box you I have so many boxes and when you actually use the SDC when you actually send things that's a complete lie you're not doing a box you are Reinventing the concept of distribut transactions really badly and without transactional santis because you're just firing stuff off like a stream of events but you don't have like this R ahead lock or any of the other stuff that the database people invented in the 60s and so there's that kind of Li of it and then when you get into the operation side increasingly it turns out sending everything is a expensive you know B really really timec consuming C actually a waste of effort and time and resources and you shouldn't do that so you need to take that enrich it corly other data look at better things figure out associations sample it and sort of figure out and finesse how you understand the data in this very operational context which is we often bundle that into the open telary collector but we never ever talk about the open open telary collector as like a required thing or even you know a thing and then so it hampers a lot of the potential of the SDK make because for example you can't update a span because a span is treated as a append only immutable log except it's a box but no it's a dependently immutable log it's a stream of events and but at the same time it turns out if you break this at any point because not are unreliable you completely M host the entire concept of what you're doing and EMB Brees all your ingestion pipelines and EMB Brees DUI of everything building everything and it's super annoying so I would love for people to think about what is it like if we made the concept of a collector or this concept of enriching rewriting the tree flattening the tree doing all these weird sorts of correlation Concepts or flattening or changing the shap of stuff to make it more malleable for you what if that was a more integral part of how we designed the SDK and if we design the Sate with more use cases in mind how do we do so in a way that gives people a simplement model but doesn't lie to them about what they can expect out in the platform so like there are client STIs Decay for example that don't send the data at all ever until they have received on the client the ending span which means that if your span is 10 seconds long and on second 9 and A2 the client process gets shut down and this not have time to send that span you lose all of that data but if you send it all to The Collector immediately you have so much traffic you can't really afford to do that but if you were able to send like a snapshot thing of a right ahead log of this isn't done yet but I'm going to I'm going to window it like databases do in 70s then okay you can work with it you can work with it and then you can patch it up and some vendors have actually started to work cleverly around hotel and work cleverly around the specification in the middle part to allow that capability in places where they need it like mobile clients and then patch it up and make it you know OTL compliant by the time you send to your back end so if we open up the Pandora b a little bit of okay maybe this is kind of necessary maybe we need to think about this in a weird way of we have to have all the things talk to each other and we need to make it more possible to do these things that make the mental model a bit more coherent when can we do that that's a lot he got thoughts um I wanted to just switch gears a little bit because um before we started uh the stream we're talking about you know you you have many thoughts on many things um and one of them was observability 3.0 now we've heard observability 2.0 um has kind of come into um our our um vernacular lately and you were talking now about observability 3.0 so can you tell us what you uh what you mean by that so what I mean by that is a really really fun thing where it gets into the heart of what I like about observability which is essentially the same thing that everybody ignores and I would like them to not ignore that and so if I brand it a little bit with like a cute little sticker maybe people will care so I'm servility 1.0 and the 2.0 is sort of a reframing of the natural progression that has happened and observability and the vendors and the capabilities and the needs of the platform and the what we need to do in order to ask the right questions and before it was sort of this is an observability and this is observability and then we're like well no it is all observability it's all about asking questions it's more what's the Fidelity of the questions what type of questions can you ask how much information is there how rich is it what are the properties of asking those types of questions and then so if we think of observability 2.0 as sort of being the ultimate inside the tech context of a company or a program or a platform can we ask essentially in question that's kind of the ultimate gole of observability 2.0 to me so for me observability 3.0 is defined by the idea that you need to take non-tech people and non-te problems and the larger context of the business and embed it into yourability to reason about your system and need to take the system and embed that into the rest of the company so the company can reason about that so observability 3.0 has a star difference in that it's not about tooling it's not about capabilities we it's not about all the sort of the technical side it's very much now we need to take the tech and we need to take the people and the processes and this you know massive budget that the you know it industry gets and stop spending it without accountability and stop spending it as this massive black hole where money goes in magic stuff comes out and nobody can explain why so can your business analysts can your marketing people can your sales people can your products people can your everybody else your customer success team can they all sit there and understand how to better serve the customer and how to better interoperate with the technology people without the technology people having screen feeding to them can you give them the capability to do a better job and can you take what they know and take all this cool stuff that they do and put it into context that lets platform engineers and product engineers and back end in and all these people do a really really good thing of being able to present technological options and be able to actually interoperate with what the company needs has a potential not just what the company has asked for you know in a guessing manner to me avability 3.0 they kind of sum it up is the business context comes in Tech the tech context goes into the business and they become one harmonious concept that's amazing and I'm sure this is going to spark a lot of conversations and I'm really excited to see you know other people's thoughts and kind of hopefully you know see the your vision um I also wanted to chat with you you know open Tre um is an open source project obviously we at cubec con um and you work you are at the nly foundation and I would love to you know have the audience learn more about kind of the story behind the foundation because um yeah she shared it earlier and I would love for you to be share that so the Le Foundation was started by Chris NOA and it was one of those last things that she did before she passed away and the nly foundation actually kind of started as an idea that germinated from hacker the Macedon instance that we all built together made into this massive thing and then did a huge migration it was live We Live streamed it and everybody learned from it it was awesome and the reason in haak that we chose the technology that we did is because you had a bunch of brains you had a bunch of people that are kind the world supp to doing a lot of things but we didn't want to rely on that because we wanted to experiment with the idea of what does it mean for a community to deeply own their own Community their own concept their own architecture their everything and this was right around the time when the community especially the Tech Community was first you know gr uping with the idea of we built this little thing and now it's kind of being taken away and we don't have control over our own you know engagement platform our own sort of communication WEA how do we never lose it again and then it turns out that as the massive like migration initially happened we almost closed registrations on haad not due to operational concerns but due to a massive legal liability and the course of how Federation works on Mason it ends up being a very very abusable Vector for putting illegal content somewhere because that content has to get syndicated onto your server and so if you run a Masson instance you are liable for anything that touches your computer but you don't really necessarily control what that is and so that is a very difficult concept and so Nova kind of ran into this and with her legal background and her legal brain she was like oh absolutely no no no no no no no and then so she ended up immediately finding lawyers sitting down and building like an LLC and we wrapped uh haad mount on L and very quietly spad this kind of information to a lot of other larger instances of you you need to now care about it you need immediately you have to immediately start caring about this because you are at risk of a huge vetor there's a huge surge of potential weight uh heat coming but it made us realize as we sat down and we kind of solved this problem when you go from a fun toy project and you take this toy project and it becomes a community there's this invisible Cliff of I have like my vision I have my dream my people and now there's everything like I I can't half ass my like licensing anymore I can't have ass my you know contributor like CLA agreement how do I get people from large SE companies or from regulated Industries to be able to contribute it turns out you can't just make their repository open shorts you have to actually make it so that their paperwork on there and is okay with it and then how about International people how about people with disabilities how about people with you know different needs how about people with different that happens okay you know we haven't even begun to solve the how you for open source how do you find open source no nobody knows the answer nobody's even gone close people are trying like Eva black as she says doing the Fant ftic job trying to create this sort of top down way and path and Avenue for the ability for companies to pay um to pay open source and for governments to pay and for all these things to happen it's going to take time but as a community we need to bottom up sort of figure out how do we pass this cliff and it's a massive cliff and nobody really knows it's coming and you don't have time to prepare for it because you don't get to choose when you become adopted and beloved by Community nobody sits down and says where Community now you just look around one day and you go these are all my friends and I love them and this is great and oh no and then there but it turns out that's only step two because it turns out that you can't really call the cncf community anymore it's an ecosystem and that's kind that third massive Cliff that very very few people talk about where you have this one project and this community and that's cool and the community maybe grows other things when it reaches this s of becoming a generation and incubation Hub of innovation of experimentation and it starts generating a fractal of different communities that all come together in this ecosystem and of this massive idea Exchange of community knowledge Shar and Community like growth when becomes this messy in articulate sort of ill defined but beautifully growing organic thing that takes on its own life that's an ecosystem and we don't even really know how to build those we definitely don't know how to fund them we definitely don't even know the differences between all the legal and the compliance how how do you facilitate that how do you how do you get there and so we looked at this problem Nova and I and a bunch of other people and we want someone need to start thinking about this it's going to take a while it's going to take several years maybe even decade or two to really deeply help the world understand how to to pass those Cliffs and turn them into this you know growing ramp of taking ideas and sharing with the world in a way that generates further ideas in a way that becomes this ever growing thing and the nly foundation which was originally sort of kind of starting as like a legal cover and legal ability to do this always was intended to be a vehicle that helps you understand that problem and helps figure out how do we make this beautiful growth and knowledge sharing possible that's so great um I think are we coming up on time so we are coming up on time um we are going to have our next guest on thank you so much Hazel it was lovely to talk with her and we will share um socials like how you can get in touch with her at the end and as well as like how you can get involved in the future humans of otel segment as well and I'm really excited if um to see you know what kind of interactions come up with uh from these conversations that we just had and yeah whatever questions comments thoughts you have definitely please let us know we would love to hear them and help connect you with hazel so we can learn even more and move forward to kind of her vision and also secretly jealous of her mental superpowers um I'm going to have to see if I can pick up any tips but um now we have our next guest on and I'm so excited hopefully you can see his cat pants because they're amazing um Ted hello hey hello how's it going going great how you all doing today not bad it's CU con thank awesome times it's like a big friend reunion mhm day two of the main cubec events which you know everyone is on fumes at this point y y MH yeah we had like we had a busy start cuz we had observability day which rejects re start with Rejects and then yep observability today and cucon day one yesterday I know it just feels like we've been just been here forever so we're so excited to have you um can you tell us a little bit about you know your role in open Telemetry and you know I'm sure a lot of our viewers who are more familiar with the project are already aware of who you are but would love an introduction yeah sure uh my name's Ted Young I'm one of the the co-founders of the project um and coming from the the open tracing side of the family uh people don't know open Telemetry is actually a merging of two prior projects open tracing and open census open sensus was mostly Google people and some Microsoft people and open tracing was everybody else and then we we merged to form open Telemetry and I continue to work on the project as a member of the governance committee uh mostly just focusing on the various um spec sigs implementation sigs uh that need um uh that that need a an extra helping hand when it comes to uh finding consensus figuring out what design is actually going to work there's some areas in otel where it's technically challenging enough that ironically it's easy to come to a a a design or at any rate is easy to determine which design is the correct one right because it's so technically challenging that the the requirements are very rigorous but then there's like other parts of open Telemetry where it's like a little more squishy where there's like one way that would be a really really good way and then there's some other ways that would like sort of work right you can't say they definitely would not work yeah right but they're not like great but when you have that situation it's so so so much harder to find consensus right because people will lock in to a particular idea yeah and then if it's possible to find some way to make it work cuz they're Engineers they will continue to promote but but there's this way it could work and uh trying to like find consensus there yeah of being like yes okay that would work but but this would work better and and getting everyone to be like well even though you prefer that one would you agree that um you're not going to convince everyone at this point to go that way like yes and like and would you be able to get everything done with this other one like yes and like okay well then would you be willing to come on board with this and help us move this forward because we all actually like need it to get done and so that's like a bit of just more like Community organizing that requires maybe kind of like an engineering design background yeah and I feel like that's where I provide the most value these days to the project that's so awesome cool so and and there's I I I feel like there's uh also you you have to like have some good diplomatic skills as well yeah uh build building trust in the community is important just absolutely um having people know that you don't have an agenda yeah yeah right and that you really are just there to like listen to everyone and help everyone really clarify the requirements um and help everyone really determine what what the best um what the best design solution would be for those requirements yeah yeah yeah and you know on on a similar vein it always brings me back too to like the whole thing with Hotel being such a like a lovely community and that it really takes the whole thing of being vendor neutral very seriously I mean we're all at three different places and we all get along um like we're all competitors but like not really because we're all moving towards the same goal and I was wondering if you could comment on like like what has to go on to like really continue to Foster that sense of of community and and not in US versus them yeah the trust yeah that's that is great so I really think there's there's two parts the simple part is that like humans generally speaking are good people um and also even though we might all work at different companies now the reality is for the most part there's just like many Tech domains there's like an observability scene right there's like the engine and product people whatever who's just like that's their bag and they're good at it and they just tend to kind of like Circle through the different orgs and companies that happen to be paying people to work on that stuff in that time so I think that's the thing that makes it easier right like it's like it's not like um we're from different planets that are in some Intergalactic war and we have like nothing in common or something we've got all this stuff to overcome it's just like like we all know each other uh um and when you're long around long enough it's like everyone cycled two or three jobs so you stop really looking at people as like representatives of a particular company it's so true yeah I think one of the things too just from like my you know very short experien is even when they are moving companies people want to stay involved in the project like they're actively seeking out roles where they can continue contributing to the project in their role so I think that speaks volumes honestly the the fact that um uh you can look at our maintainers and community members and and there's like quite a long lifespan at this point I I I actually haven't run the math but I would not be shocked if like the average age of a maintainer in otel was measured in years at this point like on average it's like two or three years I wouldn't be shocked if it's that high like people really do stick around it's so true so true and the second part of that is is structuring the project because companies there are very few like companies but there are a lot of bad incentives so when we started the project coming from other open- source projects where I had borne witness and had to deal with all the Fallout of these bad incentives or um muddy incentives causing various companies to like test the waters and like get into stuff with each other um so when we started this project we had a goal based off of our experiences of like how do we actually structure this project in a way that makes it obvious that these bad incentives are not present yeah where people can look at that and be like oh yeah that that won't work so we're not going to bother to try to we're we're not going to bother to see if we can just buy the whole TC right and take over the project by like what if just everyone who works on who's in a leadership position works for Splunk or something right like that you can't do that because once you get more than two people on the TC uh who work at one company that and you want a third person well one of those first two people has to drop out or remove companies or something yeah yeah and then when it comes to the actual shape of the project prior projects even these Big Industry things like kubernetes and whatever they tend to have this like veneer of Utopia like oh we're all just getting together for this alteristic reason of like making container scheduling work and it is like as an individual it's somewhat alteristic and that like I'm really interested in it I would love to like like push this domain forwards I want a real distributed operating system I don't even want kubernetes I want the next thing yeah um but sorry kubernetes uh but I also want the next I also want the next open Telemetry you know I want to keep pushing this stuff exactly exactly um so I'm motivated but like uh these are like billion dollar projects almost right the amount of engineering effort that goes into kubernetes over this like if you calculate the salaries that I'm sure that's at this point that's probably a billion dollars maybe maybe that's maybe that's crazy maybe it's like like a 100 million yeah it's I'm probably like way out on that one actually I can't math I mean chunk of change it's a chunk of change a lot of money when you think about developer salaries and how many people work on these projects otel on average like monthly average number of contributors is like a couple hundred Engineers I think wow on average is a couple hundred Engineers pushing some kind of PR or something at any given moment on otel it's a lot of people there A lot of money and the only reason people are getting paid to do that is because there is some incentive yeah yeah which is so nice to have that because otherwise like we're so busy already like so the fact that you have like all these like vendors who are backing otel I think speaks volumes for it cuz I I don't think we'd be where we are without that right but a problem kubernetes had when it first started and other projects that I worked on is it was there was all this interest and all this willingness to pay people to work on bootstrapping kubernetes but why that question was actually nebulous for maybe some vendors or Cloud providers it was clear how they were going to make money and thus why they should be paying people to work on this but for a lot of companies a lot of groups getting started especially the startups it was not clear how they were going to make money off of kubernetes so it was like step one spend all this money to bootstrap this thing step two figure out how to exploit it yeah and that just leaving that door open right just the fact that it wasn't really clearly defined how kubernetes was should be organized how everyone's expected to make money what part of this is going to be some shared open stack versus what part are we going to like sell things or whatever that was all just like a big question mark in the early days and should all the code live in a kubernetes GitHub or or should various startups and companies be allowed to have complete ownership of some component that lives within kubernetes and thus it lives within that company's repo right right all things like this led to just like a lot of problematic stuff right like what if one company kind of owns a component of open Telemetry they're going to build a lot of like startup brand around that component naturally right that would be the natural play would be to talk that component up and how it's kind of yours yeah right and then otel a project was like that was a cool component but now we're going in a different direction so we should deprecate that one and get a new thing yeah well that would be like the kiss of death to startup yeah for sure so you can start to see how like just leaving the door open starts to like create a situation where things like people's incentives can start to get at loggerheads yeah yeah and working on containerization stuff that led to these situations where you'd be in Spec meetings right people are making some technical proposals and everyone else is like I can't tell if this is a good idea or not this might be a good idea or this might be the beginning of some sneaky play to like insert some nasty thing so that this company can pull can can pull some crap on community later and why are they doing that they're evil no but because they need to make money off of all this money that they're spending so when we started otel we felt it needed to be very very very clear how people were going to make money yeah and how this project was going to provide value for end users for vendors for cloud providers for all the people are going to be involved that need to be Crystal Clear um cuz otherwise we were going to end up in that situation but because I we learned our lessons we did make it Crystal Clear yeah right all the code lives in open Telemetry do you want to donate something to open Telemetry that's fabulous you need to move it into otel you need to change the copyright and everything to be the otel authors you need to completely relinquish any individual ownership of this it's now collectively owned by otel and is now part of the cncf is no longer part of your startup yeah yeah um and also like uh what's the boundary of the project Telemetry we're going to standardize the data being emitted by all of these systems but storing and analyzing that data that's never going to be part of votel yeah because you wouldn't want to standardize that part you want to that's like Green Field that's the part where we're trying to figure out the Futures like what can we do with this information and we want everyone to compete on that and that's also where everyone's going to make money yeah exactly and making that very very clear yeah really did a lot in the early days as far as bringing in the second and third wave of contributing companies right like you have this first wave of people who are like we're just making this major bet because it's super clear this would be good for us and then this second wave of companies that are like well okay if those guys are all in that kind of changes the calculus for me I guess we should get involved um and then once those groups get involved there's like a third group it's like well now that all of those people are involved I guess that changes it for us and the fact that it was super clear what you would get out of this if you put something into it yeah uh made that that happened uh faster so you mentioned um you know open Telemetry is the merging of like open open sensus tracing and open senses thank you I was like open traces okay day three is okay sorry um and you know which was focused on tracing and metrics respectively and you know obviously you guys did the um project update yesterday we heard a lot of um new cool stuff coming on the pipeline did you was this part of your vision like at the beginning of the foundation of open Telemetry or is this kind of you mean like where the project is today yeah yeah I mean we've really like our original mandate were we're at kind of this interesting spot in open Telemetry where we had this original mandate which was to unify tracing metrics and logs those are the primary signals that we have available um but the problem in the past was these were siloed systems and what you're trying to do is get a completely connected coherent view of the system y um and those were the three major signals that we wanted to tackle first so that was like our original pitch we're going to merge these three signals into one graph of data that can then be walked by a computer system and we can dump all of this analysis off onto the computers instead of doing it in our brains when it comes to finding correlations across all of this information uh and that was a great pitch it's been part of actually transforming this whole industry right as the data completely changes the products of course have to completely change and if you're going from a bunch of siloed systems to like a unified platform you can see how that's just going to create a complete SE change within the industry because well if that's the future then what's going to happen well all these companies are going to consolidate right one company that was doing logging or whatever is going to acquire some companies that did the other signals and then they're going to try to merge all of that into a platform or if they're a new company they're right out of the gate they're going to be like are we a platform or how do we fit into this new new platform world where all the data is going into one spot so that's like a complete industry shift that probably would have happened anyways without otel but otel is like this massive accelerant so you incentivize basically the the the unification of the signals not not just supporting the three signals but actually right intertwining them so that you can really get that the most out of observability really right yeah and I I call you know the the old version of it I call the the three brows tabs of observability because calling it three pillars gives it too much credit like there was some intentional structure there there was that was like never an intentional design it's like a terrible design what should we do we should Silo all of the data and use our brains to try to figure out what how what connects to what like that's obviously dumb so obviously we didn't design that it just kind of acree over time yeah um and going from that to what I call the braid of data so it is all this data but it is being braided and connected in various ways yeah um and you can think of the value that comes out of a braid right you can think of like the individual strands in a rope and then you can think about a rope and how much more you can do with a rope than just uh pieces of straw yeah it's just so much stronger right exactly yeah yeah and um uh can you give folks uh just a a high level overview of what some of the updates uh that came out of the project update yesterday yeah yeah so i' would say the super high level and we didn't really cover this in the update but um exclusive exclusive but but getting back to this industry C change right being at this moment where we're finally stabilizing tracing logs and metrics right we had the kind of last piece of that um there's a little bit of work that needs to be done related to resources so if people don't know uh resources are in a way like the fourth signal right like when we there's the data there's the in the system and there's like the structure of the system and so the traces are kind of like the energy right that's the transactions that's the stuff moving through the system but then there's the actual like stuff that it's moving through and those are the resources the kubernetes Clusters the the virtual machines the um application binaries all all of that stuff um and when we started the project uh there was this idea that came from open census that these resources were immutable compared to the lifespan of a service when a service started it was associated with some resources and those resources did not change and this kind of made sense yeah uh uh because generally speaking the resources you care about with server side Computing they don't change now they do sometimes but this is just like Edge casy enough that at Google they kind of were just like B just going to ignore that um like you can freeze a virtual machine move it into a different Data Center and then like turn it back on right and now all of its resources changed it's running it's the same computer program and now it's running somewhere completely different but in practice we don't do that right so maybe you could just ignore this requirement and this was very convenient because have this obnoxious thing with resources where you want to figure all of them out before you start sending data you don't want to start sending partially indexed data which is what would happen if you started emitting Telemetry before you figured out your kubernetes pod ID or whatever but figuring out some of these resources can take time yeah you have to go query some API and like wait for the answer and you don't want to delay the booting up of your app necessarily CU what if one of these calls is failing right do you move forwards or is this gating turns out there's a lot of pernicious problems around actually Gathering all of these resources and associating them um and the biggest problem is dev's because it's annoying at startup to be like well whatever we we'll we'll do the dumb thing of we'll just tack these resources on as they come back from their various apis and then you end up with this situation where you have some partial data at the beginning how do you prevent devs from making this mistake well what if you made the resource API immutable where you could only set it once then they would try to do this right they would try to come back with some late binding resource and then the API would be like oh I can't oh this is annoying I guess I'm forced to do it the right way so it's not that resources are immutable by some intrinsic nature of what resources are resources are mutable because that was a convenient way to force the Google devs to not make this like stupid mistake oh and to to force them to do the extra effort figuring out how to resolve all of these resources uh at the beginning so to protect protect them from themselves to a certain extent this this is my claim yeah uh so um but then you get to clients right and all of this was fine this was just like fine all swans are black and then you get to client development which um we've been a little slow to get to in par because so almost all the engineers came from kind of a server side background it was just a little bit late before the client side people started showing up but when they did client side um Computing is very different right uh when the application starts and stops is actually like pretty arbitrary like it's pretty arbitrary when you hit quit on your web browser or whatever it doesn't really signify anything when program boots or ends but it goes through all these different states right like it might be foregrounded or backgrounded uh it might be on Wi-Fi or a cellular network right uh it might get put to sleep and then wake up in Hong Kong you know um and so all of these resources uh are changing over the lifespan of this application oops oops indeed damn it so that's kind of where we're at with the project where we finished our original mandate but there's like a couple of like squiggles around resources that are kind of like the last thing where it's like all right we have to do this really annoying work this is going to be really annoying for me personally because this is the exact kind of thing where it's like we need to fix this to make it work for the clients but we already told people it was immutable so can we like can we like take that back and say like some of these are immutable and some of these are not like would that screw anybody up or not like this is going to be very tricky and then we're going to have to come up with a solution and there's going to be a bunch of community people be like but we said it was immutable and then we're like but clients need to be like but I don't care cuz I'm a go developer you know like yeah so this this is this is what I do okay is try to try to to bring everyone together so we can move forward but if we can get past that yeah now we are in the Green Field of the future where we are looking at all of the data that we haven't captured yet and we want to figure out how to start bringing that data in how do we bring profiling in how do we bring um source code commits versioning all of that in yeah config files that's the future that's exciting yeah so we're you know at the like the five year five six year mark of uh the foundation what do you think is it's going to look like in another five years uh in another 5 years um pretty much the same but with more stuff tacked onto it sorry I'm going to be very boring with that answer because I think we move slow and I don't believe in 2.0's no I is just 1.0 forever uh and uh um and so I just think it'll be but there will be like a SE change that happens once you get enough of this data actually connected there's certain it unlocks certain things so I don't think you're going to see open Telemetry radically Chang in the way it looks but 5 years out from now is enough time for the analysis tools to start to catch up with where the data is so where I think you're going to see some amazing things is some amazing new analysis tools that are actually looking at all kinds of data that we can't look at today and are condensing that into to like like a helpful co-pilot at for uh an operator uh trying to figure out their system that's exciting right on and before you know we log off and get back into the real world I have to learn about your pants what is the story with these cat pants because they're fabulous they have cats on them uh you know these cats do I know them are they your cats they are not my cats I wish I wish I had personally uh fabricated these pants but I did not the internet provided these pants but I did know that these pants existed before I looked at them I was like I want pants that have kittens and space on them and I knew the internet would give this to me I had complete face and it took about 30 seconds wow internet came through it came it came through yeah you know they can make me get out of bed they can't make me get out of my pajamas that's kind of my attitude I love it all right yeah what else would you like to share before we head back into the actual event that we're all here for uh you know I would just encourage uh anyone watching um to if you're an end user please get involved in the developer experience Sig and give us feedback on your experience as an end user um in particular around uh installing the SDK and using the instrumentation apis because we want to we want to clean all that up now that things are stabilizing so yeah please get involved if that's what uh what you're interested in and speaking of end users Adriana and myself work in the end user Sig we do uh monthly events like open open Telemetry in practice um we do end user interviews to learn more about your adoption implementation process you know and get some feedback that we can share back with the sigs and we'll have a QR code at the end that you can scan to get in touch with us on the otel Sig user channel on CNC of slack and don't forget the survey that's open until the end of the week oh the doc survey the doc survey it ends Friday yes if you've used open tree. dos and any way shape or form and you have something to say about it whether good or bad or just comments or questions definitely please take the survey we will link that in the show notes I believe we can do that that is the thing we can do yeah and we should also if you go to the otel socials on I think every social platform we we're on Blu Sky X LinkedIn and Mastadon um there should some tweets also with links to the survey yes and we are available um on C slack at anytime and yeah reach out to us we'd love to hear from you and I think we're good [Music] [Applause] oh
