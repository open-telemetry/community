## What Does Observability Mean to Me?

**Iris Durish**  
To me, observability is the biggest passion of my life and my professional career. It’s one of those areas that you’re not initially interested in when you start your career because it’s not taught in school. However, once you discover it, you realize how amazing it is to help teams get the best out of their products.

**SE Nman**  
I believe observability is a significant evolution from what we have done, especially in Application Performance Management (APM). It is making tools available for everyone, moving away from just adding a post-compilation agent to creating native observability that developers and operations teams can use across all organizations.

**Kayla Riel**  
To me, observability means having peace of mind. It’s a reliable way to see what happened and what went wrong, allowing us to feel more connected to our customers and users.

**Morgan Mlan**  
Observability transcends just the computing industry. It’s about understanding how systems work and how to fix them quickly if they break. OpenTelemetry expands visibility beyond infrastructure and applications, allowing us to see any systems that impact our business.

**Henrik Reet**  
Observability is more than just monitoring. It’s about having enough information to understand a given situation. If you only look at metrics, you may have a guess that something is wrong, but with logs, events, traces, and profiling, you can combine those dimensions to pinpoint your problem.

**Vijay Samuel**  
In my role at eBay, observability means knowing if the site is running fine or not, ensuring high availability.

**Daniel Gomez Blanco**  
For me, observability is crucial for understanding complex systems to deliver a good experience for our end users.

**Doug Odard**  
As a full-stack developer, I understand the need for observability. It’s the way to see what’s happening in your system without being up all night trying to figure things out.

**Adnan**  
With the rise of OpenTelemetry and tracing, the possibilities for observability have reached an all-time high, and I’m excited about being part of this growth.

**Ren Manuso**  
Observability is about asking deeper questions of our systems and not just relying on alerts for emergencies. It allows us to explore the unknown.

## The Role of OpenTelemetry

**Morgan Mlan**  
OpenTelemetry is the tool that is making observability accessible again. It centralizes telemetry signals and allows for semantic conventions, enabling observability teams and engineering teams to focus more on building and improving observability.

**Henrik Reet**  
To me, OpenTelemetry is the vehicle for observability, enabling it for everyone. It fosters an incredible community where we can share ideas and discuss the future of observability.

**Kayla Riel**  
OpenTelemetry brings together the best of what has already been out there for instrumentation, allowing everyone to benefit from it.

**Doug Odard**  
OpenTelemetry is my passion. It extracts signals, metrics, traces, and logs from infrastructure and services, making them observable and processable on the backend.

**Vijay Samuel**  
It signifies the future for observability, providing a common standard that opens up various use cases across the industry.

## Personal Experiences with OpenTelemetry

**Adnan**  
I got involved with OpenTelemetry because I was curious about its potential. I began contributing to the documentation and realized how much I enjoyed working within this community.

**Morgan Mlan**  
I got involved in OpenTelemetry through a merger of projects. My experience with various programming languages and my role at Google led me to contribute to this open-source initiative.

**Kayla Riel**  
I joined OpenTelemetry after being asked to evaluate the current status of the Ruby project. My work has focused on stabilizing logs and metrics for Ruby applications.

**Daniel Gomez Blanco**  
I began exploring OpenTelemetry at Skyscanner to simplify how we approach infrastructure and data collection, leading to a stronger adoption of open standards.

**Vijay Samuel**  
I became involved in OpenTelemetry while working to introduce it within my company, driven by the need for a unified approach to observability.

## Favorite Signals in Observability

**Morgan Mlan**  
My favorite signal is profiling because it closes a significant gap in observability, providing code-level visibility that APM products often lack.

**Kayla Riel**  
I love traces for their storytelling ability, but I also have a soft spot for logs, as they provide essential connections to spans and traces.

**Adnan**  
My favorite signal is distributed traces because they help in understanding system behavior, especially during incidents.

**Doug Odard**  
While I appreciate all signals, I’m particularly fond of metrics for their potential in anomaly detection and machine learning applications.

**Henrik Reet**  
I’m eager for continuous profiling to become mainstream, as it can significantly enhance our understanding of system performance.

[Music] well I'm Iris durish I'm a senior observability engineer at Meo and my life uh my professional life is all about the observability I build an observability platform that provides the tools for engineering teams at Meo to monitor to observe and get the best of their obligations my name is SE nman uh I'm working at Cisco at the open source program office and I'm a member of the open Telemetry governance committee and I'm one of the co- maintainers of the open Telemetry documentation my name is Kayla Riel I work for New Relic and I'm contributing to the open Telemetry Ruby project my name is Morgan mlan I'm a director of product management and swun I've been with open cementry since day one I'm one of the co-founders of the project I'm on the governor committee uh wow what do I work on with an mtel uh bit of everything I mean early on it was literally everything I mean myself Ted and various others were doing many many jobs uh more recently uh I've involved in the release of traces and then metrics 1.0 logs 1.0 last year right now I'm working on profiling uh as well as openet sus spansion into Mainframe computer my name is Henrik Reet I am a cloud native Advocate at Dan race uh and I'm passionate about observability performance uh and I'm yeah I'm trying to help the community by uh providing content on getting started on any solutions that out my name is uh Vijay Samuel and uh I help uh do architecture for the observ platform at eBay I'm Daniel Gomez Blanco I'm a principal engineer and Skys scanner and also member of the open my name is Doug odard I'm a Senior Solutions architect with service now Cloud observability which is also formula light step um I'm also a previous customer uh of using open Telemetry for several years prior to that hey I am Adnan I work at Trace test as a developer Advocate which is you you can guess better than me what that is pretty much do bunch of everything regarding open Elementry I'm one of the contributors for the documentation for the Vlog and the uh demo my name is Ren manuso I work for honeycom Io and um I am one of the maintainers of the end [Music] user what does observability mean to me uh observability to me is the biggest fashion of my life and also my professional career career uh it is one of those areas that you are not very interested when you start your career because you don't know anything about it it's not taught in school uh it's not preached by the tech communities a lot but then you discover it and you say wow this this is amazing we're actually making a change and uh we're helping the teams make the best of their product so yeah that's all for I think observability is a is a big game changer right so it's Evolution from from what we have done in especially APM over the last few years so I worked uh I worked for a very long time at EP Dynamics and we sold APM agents to customers and and and we gave them a lot of the things that observability is promising today as well but the big change I see with observability that it's coming down let's say to everybody right so this is um this is making um the things that we did there available for everybody and even more we're moving away from this hey let's add a post compilation agent into your application to like yeah let's make Native observability let's make this a thing that developers that operation teams are using across all the organizations so to me observability means having peace of mind it means having something that you can rely on in order to see what happened and what went wrong um I think observability is also Al a way to feel more technically connected to your customers and your users so that you can see the ways that they're interacting with your software instead of just the ways that that you might interact with it I mean observability to me transcends just the Computing industry it's the ability to peer into something and understand how it works what it's doing right now uh and thus if it breaks how to fix it more quickly uh certainly when we think of open Telemetry in this industry what observability classically is me is visibility to back in infrastructure and applications kind of excitingly I think it's expanding right now right we both Telemetry we're pushing into client applications we're pushing into main frames I mentioned earlier and so it's really visibility into any systems that impact your business any technical system observa usually when you people mention of observ they say hey it's about uh it's a replacement of the old name monitoring but in fact for me is a uh it's more than monitoring because monitor is like you just look at something and OBS observa it for me is like having enough information to understand a giv situation so if you just look at metrics then okay you you you get you have a guess that something is going wrong but you don't understand so having the options to get more information like logs events exceptions traces profiling then at the end combine all those Dimensions together then you say okay I got it this is my problem and I can res so what does observability mean to me uh I belong to what is called the site engineering organization inside of eBay and uh our goal is to make sure that we can uh observe everything that's going on in the site uh and ensure that we have high availability so basically observability means knowing if the site is uh running fine or not because that's that's why I'm there what does oability mean to me as a way for us to understands what's happening within our systems because we run quite a complex system so like we need to understand what goes on inside of them so we can deliver a good experience for our end users at the end of the day oh my God so observability is to me I've been an a full stack developer for years and so as we observe I actually I ended up on an incident Response Team uh doing um tracking of incident but also trying to figure out what was wrong and it pointed out to me how much we need this uh how much how hard it was to look at so many different screens and so durability for me is the way to actually see what's happening in your system it's the Pinnacle of not being up the whole night trying to figure out what went wrong and with with open Telemetry and with the rise of tracing the last couple of years it has hit an all-time high with regards to the possibilities that we have right now so I'm just really really happy to be part of the project I'm also really happy that um it's growing at that pace that it's growing right now and I can't see what how that's going to evolve within the next couple of years for me observability is about being able to ask deeper questions of our systems being able to um demand I think more or than just alerting on things that are emergencies things we've seen before but actually being able to go out into the unknown and understand how complex systems are [Music] performing op Telemetry is the tool that is making observability great again uh I would say that observability is seeing the surge now that open Telemetry is becoming so popular it's allowing Central ation of telemeter signals it's allowing semantic conventions and it's generally helping observability teams and the engineering teams uh take more attention to the observability and building it and making it better what does open tement mean to me um I think it's the vehicle for observability right I mean it's it's enabling that and uh I I joined open telet Community a few years back because I was curious is about like this idea to bring observability to everybody um and I think we are doing a really good job and what it also means to be now is that it's an amazing Community right so we're at cucon here and I meet so many people I just know from those digit conversations and now I can talk to them in person and we talk a lot about open Telemetry but we also talk a lot about other things than open Telemetry we talk about observability of course about what we think about is going to happen in a few years and and all those other things and and that's what's open Telemetry me so open Telemetry to me seems like it's a community effort to take the best of what's already been out there for instrumentation and collect it in one group so that everyone can benefit from it I think that we've learned so much as different agent Engineers but there's also so much to learn from users of products themselves and open Telemetry does a great job of bringing both people who are you know experts in observability and experts in languages to make something it's really great and meaningful for everyone I mean open cemetry is my baby put so much effort into creating this project um what does it mean to me I mean there's the boring answer which is it extracts signals metrics traces logs profiles everything else from your infrastructure from your services from your clients makes those observable processable on the back end but I think to a lot of us who've been in this community so long and a lot of us like yourself and Henrik here and others who participated in the community so much I mean hotel is also just a really nice open source Community to participate in it's a thing I just enjoy working on uh I know that's abstract and kind of like a sort of squishy thing to say but but I don't know hotel has a lot of meaning to me in many different ways all very positive open chetry for me is uh means the future uh because at the end uh by having an open standard we have uh the luxury I would say uh to to have a common standard for common format for all the solution of the markets and and having that common formats for all the industry and all the vendors and all the solutions it will just open use cases I think testing used to rely uh on I don't know uh feedback from users and now with observable data we can be so much efficient in the way with testing uh we could be so much efficient in replacing marketing tools uh business analytics tools I think it's the future and one thing that also uh a lot of people talk about AI everywhere machine learning blah blah blah blah but I think it's the same thing as a Testa I mean Tesla when you drive your car uh it takes decisions based on the sensors that you measure and if you don't have those sensors and those measurements then you can have a smart you can have the smartest systems but without the data you canot take the right decisions so I think it's an enabler also for the future implementations of modern applications open telary is the standard for observability uh going forward uh and it's very important because as we have gone through the Journey of observability over the past few years we have had to hunt for Open Standards in Prometheus and few others uh now at least with uh ingestion and collection uh it's a single standard for everyone to adopt and I think that's uh pretty powerful uh for the long run what does open t mean to me that I think is bringing people together bringing everyone together under one single language and one single way of like thinking about Telemetry I think human languages are difficult enough for us to understand each other and I think you know open Telemetry is bringing the technology together under one single way of like thinking about tety thinking about how we observe our systems to me open Telemetry is bringing um the ability to have product teams infrastructure teams helping their jobs make it easier um and also just improve the customer experience and just make it overall a better experience to do our jobs elemetry is the I'm going to say the future of of observability we've seen so many companies so many vendors move to an open Telemetry first mindset and the way that you can use open Telemetry to to generate them to actually gather all Telemetry signals with one set of libraries with one tool is just the way it was supposed to be you're not locked into one to one vendor one cloud provider anymore you can do basically whatever you want and you can use both the metric logs and traces for basically anything you want to do so really happy to see it bro open Telemetry is a instrumentation protocol um that um helps us ask more detailed questions about observability because it collects multiple signals um from many flexible types of systems um every folks monitor everything from the control plane um in kubernetes all the way up to um physical on Prem systems it's a really flexible language and it's a beautiful community of humans that came together over the pandemic to build something really [Music] special I was working in a very fast pacing observability team and we were maintaining a lot of tools and we really did not have conventions there we did not have centralizations and we really were not flexible when it came to beend uh and vendor agnostic in general so we discovered this amazing tool called open Telemetry we said okay let's give it a try it worked great for us and here I am today uh one year later more than one year later and uh uh let's say pushing the migration to open Telemetry in my second project how how did I got involved into open tele so yeah I mentioned that so so I got curious a few years ago so I was um I was at up Dynamics working as a so-called domain architect and I was an expert for noas python and a lot of those other languages and there was always this conversation around like hey there's this thing now called open Telemetry and should we not integrate this into our product and I was like okay I want to learn more then I was like what is a good way to learn something new about an open source technology yeah get involved into that so I was involved into JavaScript at some point and then at some point I realized like yeah but if I really want to get a good view into open Telemetry doing documentation is a good way into that and that's how I ended up being a maintainer for the documentation I got involved in open Telemetry uh last spring when a New Relic asked me to take a look at what the current status was of the op Elementry Ruby project I also work as an engineer on the New Relic Ruby agent team and that gave me an opportunity to start to contribute to the project and I noticed that a lot of the signals for Ruby weren't yet stable so a lot of my work so far has been going into trying to bring logs and metrics to stability and M I was working at Google on Google's observability products like tracing profiling debugging that's whole thing uh and one of the challenges we had tracing was getting data from people's applications really really hard you need Integrations of hundreds of thousands of pieces of software no one team no one company is going to maintain that it's just infeasible uh and so we wanted to do something open source there were other open source standards there was one that had started I think roughly around the same time we were doing this called open tracing restart open census at some points uh especially amongst the more social media Savvy members of the team which I am not one of uh there was some contention between those projects uh about uh where you know people who maintain databases and langage front time things should actually spend their integration efforts uh and was limiting the success of both projects so I was leading open census Ted and Van and others were leading over tracing and uh in late 2018 early 2019 we we finally sort of brought things to a head and decided to merge those into what is now called open Slumber TR uh so that's that's sort of you know I've been involved since then I've been now I work at squ different company but still on the same of things but that's how my M started and it's just grown and grown and snowball when I started the adventure in oiv of course I joined diant TR and dant TR has their their vendor agent called one agents and uh I saw this movement of open Telemetry and coming from the performance background I looked at it and I said wow an open stereo that sounds quite exciting because I had a performance a gig for a customer where I implemented like a collecting logs and processing it and putting machine learning and I told myself at that time I said I would be so wonderful to have one common standard so then instead of doing a custom implementation I could have something for everyone and when I looked at the uh just definition of the project and and the things behind the project I was so excited I said oh gosh I want to be involved in a project and that's where I started to build content to help the community get started uh I'm I used to be a developer but I'm a bad developer for sure so that's why I'm trying to help the project in other way in other directions uh and yeah my my goal is uh increase the adoptions of the Open Standards uh making sure that it's been uh adopted everywhere so then we can move forward by fling even more exciting uh implementations I started a few years ago uh for two reasons one we were uh looking to introduce ing inside the company uh and at that time uh open tracing and open sensus was converging into open Telemetry uh we started evaluating um open Telemetry for that and given that we were moving into open Telemetry for tracing we I also uh went through the Journey of migrating our uh metrics collection uh into open Telemetry that's that's that's basically how I got uh involved how did I get involved in open I got involved through uh I work as sky scanner as an end user I was uh driving adoption of Open Standards open Telemetry uh during Co there was a a need for simplification and how we approach an infrastructure how we approach how we collect how we process how we export Le of data and also basically to um to basically lead the adoption of of uh Open Standards and that simplification as so as an ability Le I go more involved into the community as Telemetry decid to interact with all end users and meeting people that want to solve the same problems they want to find a solution that works for so M Telemetry I um actually for several years in my previous position I was hired to actually develop um observability software um I was writing my own thing uh we were doing a lot of alert management and various things it was so much work and I thought this has got to be easy plus I wanted to make sure that it could be future future proof there I use that term um but also extensible and when I discovered open Telemetry I was just like oh thank you uh because it's something that the the company could carry forward and also we didn't have to worry about storing the data um as much and so it it's really provided a really excellent platform so that we can focus on the task at hand versus how how to do the job so how I got involved in the project was actually first as a customer um I was it was about three close to four years ago kind of the infancy of open Telemetry and I would go online I would look at the documentation or I would be in the code a lot but I wanted to learn more so I would go to a s call and um there would be someone from Google and Microsoft and other companies and then there was this guy from this uh small fintech in the US and at at first it was a little awkward but they were so excited to have me in the call because they I was an end user and so it really was it was a wonderful experience to begin that way to realize that I could could contribute to this um rather than simply be a consumer of it so it was great and then I transitioned my career into working for a vendor uh and we Implement these systems now for customers like myself that I was years ago so it's it's kind of a pay forward give back type of thing how did we get involved into the open project we started contributing more to the blog with you guys started contributing a bit to the the dogs as well and yeah it's just been a wholehearted effort in the team to always kind of dedicate a few a few minutes of of each day to to check out the op project and to find a way to contribute to I got involved in the open Telemetry project honestly I was working at one observability company in marketing and um they didn't see the point they didn't want me to get involved and um the I really believed in open source I'd worked at Mozilla and Wikipedia and really believe that like this was the way forward um strategic perspective so the second I could switch to a company that did let me get involved that's what I did and now I'm at honeycomb and I'm glad to say within the first three months I Made Project member and started working with the end user working group and worked to grow it into a Sig into into all the programs that it has today together with [Music] others racing is my favorite signal my favorite signal now is profiling because I think this is really closing a big gap that was missing in observability right so I mentioned before right I come from the APM space and now for me APM observability it's very hard to to make like difference here but one thing that when I talk with people using APM products right now is they're like Hey where's code level visibility with open televis right my commercial agent is giving me that line of code that is breaking something and this is what we get with profiling and that's why I'm really really excited about it to decide a favorite signal is kind of difficult for me I really love the power of traces I think that traces can tell stories in ways that are very meaningful but on the same like on the other hand uh I've been so immersed in logs and trying to allow logs to have more connections to spans and traces but I definitely have a sof spot for logs as well uh I mean I'm partial to distributed traces because that's where this project got it start and I think early on that's where a lot of the value was no one else was really doing standardized distributed Trace collection right there were some open source examples of it attached to like zipin and jger but I think the reason open slage we got so much traction so quickly is that it was providing that I'm also partial to logs which we launched last year just because that's one where like I've been involved in a lot of parts of hotel but that's one where like I was involved in a lot of the core specific early on and driving that and so it was really exting to see that ship also logs are just a thing that throughout my career before working on any of this I just get frustrated with because they're never standardized they slow to process they're expensive hotel's going to bring a lot of changes there for the better for everyone who uses Vlogs and finally I guess profiles cuz I'm working on that now and it's new I when I was in Google many years ago I launched what I think was the world's first distributed like continuous profiling product at least publicly available one which was Google Cloud profiling stack profiling they still support it I still think it's free it's very powerful uh and but profiling has always been a bit of a niche thing like I I know like it's spunk and other companies we support it but it's not as well known as metrics and traces block I think with otel starting to later this year we're going to launch like full support for profiles that's really going to change things like I we had customers at Google who would spend an hour of our profiler and save like 20 30% of their aggre CU cuz they found some really poorly optimized code really quickly for more people to have that ability and speed to speed things up and for developers actually to get insight on how things work that's super exciting like the tech has been there a long time and hotel bringing this mainstream is huge when people ask me who is your favorite kid usually I say I don't have a favorite kid you know uh all my kids are wonderful uh they all have a h i don't know a a great thing you know out of it so I think I love traces because sometimes it help you to understand where it's slowed down I love metrics because as a performance engineer I used to use metrics a lot and I love logs because logs at the end there's no sing so if you just do analytics on logs wow you you are so much precise so I I don't think I'll have a a favorite signals I'll just say that depending on on what I needs and pick and choose there's clearly one signal that will help me more uh there's one thing that I'm I'm very eager and waiting since Valencia is continues profiling uh because it's uh I love profiling and I think traces is great but if there is a problem somewhere profiling would be so much helpful so I think uh yeah I don't answer any questions but I say yeah I love all the the signals provided by open I am thoroughly biased towards uh metrics uh I feel metrics uh are the most powerful signal uh as long as you are uh thinking through your instrumentation and making sure that you have the right granularity SL cardinality uh being sent in to the platform uh you can do powerful powerful things uh with regards to anomal detection machine learning and many other things so uh I love metrics I mean I have to say traces because they give you the content tracers give you the backbone corelation for all the other signals right but I do saying that the the current like design of the API design of metric is so powerful that I'm like falling in love again with metrics because of that way that we decouple uh instrumentation and measurement from aggregation of those metrics so powerful and so much uh richness to basically give us a way to describe our system that I'm calling back again in love mentions my favorite signal I have to say I'm arshal the traces uh because I'm I've been doing software development for so long that that was the first thing that really turned me on to it was the ability to see that um especially because I know what it's like to debug but it's also I also know what it's like in an incident to have to focus in very quickly so yes traces are my favorite uh but I do also like to send that Trace ID and and span ID into the logs now it's kind of becoming my next favorite uh my favorite singal is traces I'm going to say traces definitely uh my favorite singer is Ed sh what is my favorite signal I mean I work for honeycom so I am constitutionally obliged to say traces are my favorite signal [Music]
