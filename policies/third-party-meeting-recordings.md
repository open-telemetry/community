# Third-party meeting recording policy

OpenTelemetry hosted meetings are recorded and transcribed by Zoom and made available for the convenience of the community ([details here](../docs/how-meeting-recordings-upload-works.md)).
Third-party recording tools, note-taking apps, and other tools which record, transcribe, or otherwise process OpenTelemetry Zoom meetings are prohibited.
This is to respect participants' privacy and ensure data governance by the OpenTelemetry Governance Committee rather than third-party companies and individuals.
Maintainers may remove and block such tools using the process described in [Zoom abuse prevention](../docs/how-to-handle-public-calendar.md#zoom-abuse-prevention).
