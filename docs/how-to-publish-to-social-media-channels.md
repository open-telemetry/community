# How to publish to social media channels

The OpenTelemetry project maintains multiple social media channels, that can be leveraged by SIGs to promote their work and draw attention to discussions.

This guide outlines how SIG members (approvers, maintainers) can submit content for publication.

Note, that blog posts can be submitted through an issue and pull request to the [open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/) following [this guideline](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/contributing/blog/).

Note, that the purpose of this guideline is to provide broad access across SIGs to the social media channels of the project. There are activities and automation, especially by SIG Comms and SIG End-User, that publish to those channels as well.

## Before submitting a content for social media

Social media content should not be commercial in nature and should consist of original content that applies broadly to the OpenTelemetry community. They should follow the policies outlined in the [Social Media Guide](../social-media-guide.md) and [Marketing Guidelines](../marketing-guidelines.md).

## Submitting content for social media

* Raise an issue with the following details:
  * Title of the content
  * Description of the content
  * If applicable, a list of technologies used in the content. Make sure that all of them are open source and prefer CNCF projects over non-CNCF projects
  * Name all SIGs, that are related to ths content
  * Name one SIG, that is sponsoring the content.

Members of `@open-telemetry/social-media-approvers` will triage your issue and request reviews from the appropriate SIGs.

## Example 1

* A community member wants to create a YouTube video about setting up the Collector.
* The member raises an issue which either contains the outline of the video or links to existing raw material.
* The issue will be assigned to the `@open-telemetry/social-media-approvers`. They will pull in collector approvers&maintainers and within their own group pick the right expert (for YouTube) to work with the community member.
* After reviews and approvals the contents get published.

## Example 2

* A community members wants to promote a certain issue in their repository via social media channels.
* The member raises an issue with a pointer to the other issue and some details why they want this to be promoted.
* The issue will be assigned to the ``@open-telemetry/social-media-approvers`. They will pull in other members of the SIG owning the repo to confirm that this is in the interest of the SIG.
* After reviews and approvals the contents get published.
