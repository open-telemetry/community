# How to publish to social media channels

The OpenTelemetry project maintains multiple social media channels that can be leveraged by SIGs to promote their work and draw attention to discussions.

This guide outlines how SIG members (approvers, maintainers) can submit content for publication.

Blog posts can be submitted through an issue and pull request to the [open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/) following [these guidelines](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/contributing/blog/).

The purpose of this guide is to provide broad access across SIGs to the social media channels of the project. SIG Comms and SIG End-User publish to these channels as well, sometimes using automation.

## Before submitting content for social media

Social media content should not be commercial in nature and should consist of original content that applies broadly to the OpenTelemetry community. The content should follow the policies outlined in the [Social Media Guide](../social-media-guide.md) and [Marketing Guidelines](../marketing-guidelines.md).

## Submitting content for social media

* [Raise a community issue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/new/) with the following details:
  * Title of the content
  * Description of the content
  * If applicable, a list of technologies used in the content. Make sure that all of them are open source and prefer CNCF projects over non-CNCF projects
  * Name of all SIGs that are related to the content
  * Name of one SIG that is sponsoring the content

Your issue will be tagged with `area:social-media` and members of `@open-telemetry/social-media-approvers` will triage your issue and request reviews from the appropriate SIGs.

## Example 1

* A community member wants to create a YouTube video about setting up the Collector.
* The member raises an issue which either contains the outline of the video or links to existing raw material.
* The issue is assigned to the `@open-telemetry/social-media-approvers`, who pull in Collector approvers and maintainers. The right expert, one who is comfortable on camera, is chosen by the Collector SIG to work with the community member.
* After reviews and approvals, the video is published.

## Example 2

* A community member wants to promote a certain issue in their repository using the project's social media channels.
* The member raises an issue that points to the issue to be promoted and provides details about why they want to promote it.
* The issue is assigned to the `@open-telemetry/social-media-approvers`, who pull in other members of the SIG owning the repository to confirm that promoting the issue is in the interest of the SIG.
* After reviews and approvals, the content is published.
