# How to create and configure meetings

In OpenTelemetry we are using the CNCF's Zoom accounts. We currently own four
identical zoom accounts, though most meetings are created by the first account.

All rooms are configured the same way. Some notes on meetings configuration:

- **The host is not required** to join the meeting. Anybody can join the meeting.
- **There is no time limit on the length of the meeting**. Please make sure nobody is
  using this room for another meeting on the calendar when meeting is going long
  over time.
- **Auto-recording is enabled for all meetings**. All OpenTelemetry public meetings are being recorded automatically. Find recordings at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHZDBZTIfdy94xMjMKz-_MA).

Every meeting must contain a link to the meeting notes. The meeting notes
document must be shared with write or commenting permissions.

Anyone can request to be added or removed as a meeting participant. Request can
be made via GitHub issue on this repository or contacting SIG maintainer via
other channels like Gitter.

All meetings must include [OpenTelemetry Calendar Invites Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/opentelemetry-calendar)
as a participant. Anybody who wants to recieve up to date invites for all OpenTelemetry
meetings can join the group.

## Steps
To create or edit a meeting, you need to have access to the Public OpenTelemetry calendar (a shared Google calendar)
and access to one of our Zoom accounts or to a Google account that has already been linked to Zoom (such as cncf-opentelemetry-governance).

### Gaining Calendar Permissions
All SIG maintainers have permission to edit the Public OpenTelemetry calendar.
To get access to the calendar, please join the Google Group opentelemetry-calendar-contributors@googlegroups.com by submitting a request [here](https://groups.google.com/g/opentelemetry-calendar-contributors).
If your identity is not recognizable from the e-mail you are using to request joining the group, please
request to be added to this Google Group by creating an issue in this repository.

Please keep the membership of this group up to date and accurate.

### Gaining Zoom Permissions
To create a new meeting, you will need to either link one of the OpenTelemetry Zoom accounts to your public calendar,
or you can use the credentials for the cncf-opentelemetry-governance@lists.cncf.io Google account. Currently, using a shared set of credentials for
the cncf-opentelemetry-governance@lists.cncf.io Google account is the preferred way to make edits, as it is already linked to Zoom.

You can gain access to the shared Google account by following the steps in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gt9ctxKGPrM_XTINqLgkSxYypdrczHkt2znjwgBU4UU/edit#).

## Zoom bombing prevention
All meetings are created by Zoom with randomized passcodes, which are embedded into the shared calendar links.
All members of opentelemetry-calendar-contributors@googlegroups.com have access to [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gt9ctxKGPrM_XTINqLgkSxYypdrczHkt2znjwgBU4UU/edit#)
listing the host keys for our meetings and explaining how to deal with inappropriate behavior in Zoom.
