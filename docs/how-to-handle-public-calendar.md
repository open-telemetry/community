# How to create and configure meetings

In OpenTelemetry we are using CNCF zoom account. We currently own four
identical zoom accounts. The default room from every single account is
used and a room can only host one meeting at a time. These are the
account rooms:

- https://zoom.us/j/6729396170
- https://zoom.us/j/8203130519
- https://zoom.us/j/8287234601
- https://zoom.us/j/5227112777

Meetings with the same room must not be held at the same time or be adjacent.

All rooms are configured the same way. Some notes on meetings configuration:

- **Host is not required** to join the meeting. Anybody can join the meeting.
- **There is no time limit on the length of the meeting**. Please make sure nobody is
  using this room for another meeting on the calendar when meeting is going long
  over time.
- **Auto-recording is enabled for all rooms**. All OpenTelemetry public meetings are being recorded automatically. Find recordings at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHZDBZTIfdy94xMjMKz-_MA).

Every meeting must contain a link to the meeting notes. The meeting notes
document must be shared with write or commenting permissions.

Anyone can request to be added or removed as a meeting participant. Request can
be made via GitHub issue on this repository or contacting SIG maintainer via
other channels like Gitter.

All meetings must include [OpenTelemetry Calendar Invites Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/opentelemetry-calendar)
as a participant. Anybody who wants to recieve up to date invites for all OpenTelemetry
meetings can join the group.

All SIG maintainers have permission to edit the Public OpenTelemetry calendar.
To get access to the calendar, please join the Google Group opentelemetry-calendar-contributors@googlegroups.com by submitting a request [here](https://groups.google.com/g/opentelemetry-calendar-contributors).
If your identity is not recognizable from the e-mail you are using to request joining the group, please
request to be added to this Google Group by creating an issue in this repository.

Please keep the membership of this group up to date and accurate.

## Zoom bombing prevention
All meetings now require a passcode to join: _77777_. This passcode is embedded into the calendar meeting invites and meeting notes documents.
All members of opentelemetry-calendar-contributors@googlegroups.com have access to [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gt9ctxKGPrM_XTINqLgkSxYypdrczHkt2znjwgBU4UU/edit#)
listing the host keys for our meetings and explaining how to deal with inappropriate behavior in Zoom.
