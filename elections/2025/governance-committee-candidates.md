### Austin Parker

- Company: [honeycomb.io](https://honeycomb.io)
- GitHub: [austinlparker](https://github.com/austinlparker)

I'm Austin Parker, current Governance Committee member and long-time OpenTelemetry contributor. Since the earliest days of the project, I've been a consistent advocate for users, contributors, maintainers, and organizations adopting OpenTelemetry. Outside of OpenTelemetry, I'm Director of Open Source at honeycomb.io, a chair of Observability Day at KubeCon, and an author/speaker on OpenTelemetry and observability-related topics. Recently, like everyone else, I've been getting into AI! Neat stuff.

Over the past two years, I've been honored to serve this community as it continues to grow and mature. During that time, I've led several initiatives that I hope to continue -

- I've led the [OpenTelemetry Graduation](https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1739) initiative, which has included a wide variety of cross-functional tasks: helping to run our first [security audit](https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2024/security-audit-results/), working to improve our documentation and processes across the project, and much more.
- Along with other GC and TC members, I led the creation and bootstrapping of the Project Infrastructure SIG. This SIG is dedicated to handling cross-functional needs from our many sub-projects around tooling, GitHub management, cloud resources, etc. To date, we've launched several important projects to improve the security and reliability of builds and publishing, established complimentary cloud resources through Oracle Cloud for project use, and worked to get OpenTelmetry added to the Docker Sponsored Open Source program, unblocking our ability to publish to Docker Hub.
- With the CNCF, launched the first Open Source Observability Summit alongside a refreshed OTel Community Day in order to offer more platforms for our community to meet, interact, learn, and grow.
- Led the creation of the inaguaral [OpenTelemetry Community Stars](https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2024/community-awards/), an annual award designed to recognize the contributions of community members.

If elected, I plan to continue work on these important initiatives, and more. OpenTelemetry is an international community, and I pledge to bring more community events to regions outside North America, such as Europe and APAC. The strength of our project is in its people, and its maintainers, and I will continue to work to improve opportunities for developing the next generation of maintainers through mentoring programs and a renewed drive on supporting language communities (eg, working with language SIGs to bring OpenTelemetry into their language community through events, workshops, etc.) Finally, I believe it's important for us to renew our focus on developers. Generative AI promises to greatly expand the number of people who are creating, and running, code over the next five years. We need to provide a solid foundation of tooling, documentation, and extension points that allow for a delightful and 'AI-native' experience of using OpenTelemetry. If elected, I will dedicate time to supporting and contributing to projects such as local development tooling, AI native documentation, MCP servers for OpenTelemetry, and more.

Thank you for your vote. It is, truly, an honor to serve this community.

### Damien Mathieu

- Company: [Elastic](https://elastic.co)

Hi,

I'm Damien. I've been in the trenches of OpenTelemetry as a contributor and maintainer since 2019.

Over the past few years, I have been involved in several SIGs:

* I am a maintainer of the **Go SDK** SIG
* I am an approver for the **Collector**
* I am an approver for the **eBPF Profiler** SIG
* I am a member of the **Developer Experience** SIG
* I am a maintainer for the **French** localization

I believe OpenTelemetry is at a critical turning point. It's time to move from a tool for experts to a platform for everyone. If elected, my mission is singular: forge an unparalleled user experience.

Here is my pledge:

* **Solidify Our Foundation**: My top priority is to make participation in OpenTelemetry clear, fair, and rewarding. I will work with contributors, maintainers, and vendors to reduce friction in our processes, ensure recognition for all types of contributions, and keep engagement sustainable.
* **Ignite Ecosystem Innovation**: We must be more than a spec; we must be the epicenter of observability. I will champion collaborations with other projects and create fertile ground for radical experimentation, ensuring OpenTelemetry keeps leading the future.
* **Preserve and Evolve Our Foundations**: To support our future, we need governance processes that remain transparent, balanced, and adaptable. I will help refine and maintain the systems that already work well while ensuring they continue to scale with the growth of our community.

My deep involvement as a maintainer and contributor of many SIGs has given me the cross-project insight needed to make this vision a reality.

### Juraci Paixão Kröhling

![Juraci Paixão Kröhling](static/jpkroehling.webp)

- Company: [OllyGarden](https://ollygarden.com)
- GitHub: [jpkrohling](https://github.com/jpkrohling)

I'm Juraci Paixão Kröhling, and I'm running for my third term on the OpenTelemetry Governance Committee (GC). I've been serving on the GC since 2021, and during this time I've also transitioned to my own company, OllyGarden, where OpenTelemetry is at the center of our strategy.

From an engineering perspective, I created foundational tools that continue serving the community today, such as the OpenTelemetry Operator and the OpenTelemetry Collector Builder (ocb). I helped create key Collector features including the auth mechanism (creating the first auth extensions), the load balancing exporter, and maintained modules like the tail sampling processor for several years.

During my previous terms on the Governance Committee, I helped strengthen communication between the Governance and Technical Committees, mediated community conflicts, and coordinated OpenTelemetry's participation in Outreachy internship programs. I've facilitated significant donations such as Grafana Beyla (which became OpenTelemetry eBPF Instrumentation) and spoken at conferences worldwide. Since the beginning of this year, I'm focused on working directly with organizations to understand how they use OpenTelemetry in production and what challenges they face with telemetry quality and efficiency, bringing that knowledge back to the community.

My commitment to the project has also led me to start several side projects after talking to people who expressed specific community needs. I launched "Dose de Telemetria" to provide quality content in Portuguese, later expanded with "Telemetry Drops" for English-speaking audiences, and started the in-person OTel Night meetup in Berlin in response to the wish for local community gatherings.

If re-elected, my focus will be on telemetry quality: working with different stakeholders, including end-users, to improve the quality and efficiency of telemetry created with our diverse OpenTelemetry tools. Re-election would also give me renewed strength to continue my side-mission of creating quality content and organizing OTel Night.
