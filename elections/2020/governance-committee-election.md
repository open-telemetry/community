# OpenTelemetry 2020 Governance Committee election

This document lays out the 2020 election process per the OpenTelemetry
governance committee
[charter document](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/master/governance-charter.md#establishment-of-a-governance-committee)
requirements.

In this election there are four seats that need to be filled. The nominees list
will be shared October 15th, voting will take place October 26th-28th, and the
results will be announced October 30th.

We highly encourage participation in this election cycle to ensure that the
community is well-represented by the Governance Committee.

# Voting process

The 2020 election process can be tracked via [this GitHub
issue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/488). Ben Sigelman
from the current Governance Committee and any volunteers from the community
will play the role of the election committee this year. Note that election
committee members may not run in the election, though they may vote. We strive
for transparency in the election process and hold the interests of the
community as our first priority. In particular, we will ensure that all
documents and assets related to the 2020 election process are public, and we
will attempt to record and distribute notes for any meetings held as part of
this process.

# Nominations

As per
[the charter document](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/master/governance-charter.md#establishment-of-a-governance-committee),
anybody is eligible to run for the Governance Committee. During the “call for
nomination” period, people can be nominated or nominate themselves by
submitting a Pull Request adding said candidate to the
[governance-committee-candidates.md](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/master/elections/2020/governance-committee-candidates.md)
file in the OpenTelemetry community repository. The template in that file includes
the following columns:
* Full name
* GitHub alias
* Company affiliation
* Short bio and/or reasoning to join the Governance Committee (no more than a
  short paragraph)
* _Optional_: photo/picture of a nominee

The Pull Request will not be merged until the candidate has confirmed their
desire to be nominated (if not self-nominating) and ratification has occurred
via PR comments.

The email address of the nominee should also be sent to
[cncf-opentelemetry-governance@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-opentelemetry-governance@lists.cncf.io) –
it will be kept private and used only for candidate communications as the
election process proceeds.

The Governance Committee or appointed people will contact every nominee
directly to ensure the commitment and desire to be nominated.

# Voter pre-registration

All active GitHub contributors will receive a voting link to the email
associated with their commits. If your code contributions do not meet
eligibility requirements, but you are eligible for voting with the non-code
contributions, you need to pre-register so a voting link can be sent.

The form will ask for email and a proof of eligibility for the vote. Criteria
for voting eligibility are listed in the Members of Standing section of the
[charter document](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/master/governance-charter.md#members-of-standing).

One of two options will be available in the form to prove eligibility:

* GitHub handle
* List either…
  * Your contributions to OpenTelemetry that make you eligible to vote, or
  * Your non-code contributions per the [Members of Standing section of the charter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/master/governance-charter.md#members-of-standing):
    particularly, your relationship to a well-known project that’s taken a hard
    dependency on OpenTelemetry, and/or your involvement with a well-known
    organization’s adoption of OpenTelemetry as an end-user.

The link to the pre-registration form: [NEEDS UPDATE](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/488#issuecomment-700967483)

Note that all pre-registrations will be verified by the Governance Committee
for eligibility.

All pre-registrations are private. Only the members of a current governance
committee and election committee will have access to this information. Lists
will be discarded one month after the election.

# Vote

Everyone with voting rights will receive the link to the voting site.
[Condorcet Internet Voting Service](https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/) (CIVS) – a
ranked-choice voting system – will be used for the voting process.
* The Condorcet-IRV algorithm will be used to calculate the results
* The “No Opinion” option will be enabled

Late registrations to vote and requests to re-send the voting link will be
accepted via email to
[cncf-opentelemetry-governance@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-opentelemetry-governance@lists.cncf.io).
We encourage pre-registration to minimize the effort required to run this
election.

Per CIVS, voting is completely private: nobody will know any individual's vote.

# Results

Voting will close at 12:01am GST on 2020/10/28. Nominees will be stack ranked.
If a nominee becomes ineligible (for instance, if more than 2 topmost nominees
work for the same company), those nominees will be skipped and the nominee with
the next-highest score will be picked.

Exact scores for each candidate will NOT be made public (unlike the 2019
election).
