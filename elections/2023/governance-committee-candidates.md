I’m Daniel Gomez Blanco, Principal Software Engineer at Skyscanner where I’ve
been leading an organisation-wide observability transformation underpinned by
the use OpenTelemetry across 1,000+ services, and I’m asking for your vote to
help me bring an end-user view to the Governance Committee.

Over the last few years, my contributions to the community have been focused on
advocating adoption of OpenTelemetry tooling in an efficient way, while
promoting observability best practices to maximise the ROI of telemetry
instrumentation. As external outputs, these contributions include:

- Authoring [Practical OpenTelemetry: Adopting Open Observability Standards Across Your Organization](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-9075-0).
- Delivering conference talks (e.g. [QCon London 2023](https://qconlondon.com/presentation/mar2023/effective-and-efficient-observability-opentelemetry)
, [O11yfest 2021](https://o11yfest.org/speakers/daniel-gomez-blanco), sharing
my experience on how organisations can benefit from adopting OTel and how to do
it efficiently.
- Participating in several interviews, case studies, panels, and podcasts to
discuss observability best practices and the value of OTel.

At Skyscanner, my job as a platform engineer involves driving the strategy for
a transition to open standards with minimal friction, providing the necessary
enablement tooling, and guiding over 700 engineers across dozens of teams to
make the best use of each telemetry signal to instrument and observe their
systems, from the client-side all the way down to backend services and their
underlying infrastructure. Reaping the benefits of effective observability from
the many terabytes of telemetry data going through our collectors every hour,
and empowering a reliable experience for millions of users of our product each
month, makes this an ever exciting challenge!

Previous to OpenTelemetry, I have extensive experience as a platform engineer
working in a wide range of observability-related areas, having led workstreams
in frontend performance optimisation, custom telemetry pipelines, open-source
observability tooling, and Kubernetes resource optimisation.

As a practitioner, I believe I can bring first-hand insights to the GC about
the challenges that organisations of any size can face, and help to drive
initiatives to address those, bridging the gap between enablement and adoption.

### Juraci Paixão Kröhling

- Company: Grafana Labs
- GitHub: [jpkrohling](https://github.com/jpkrohling)

I'm Juraci Paixão Kröhling, a passionate open-source software engineer, and I'm
seeking your support for my re-election to the OpenTelemetry Governing Board. My
commitment to the project runs deep and I have chosen an employer willing to
sponsor my upstream work full time. Since my election in 2021, I've actively
contributed to the OpenTelemetry project and the wider observability community.
Here are some concrete examples of what I've accomplished during my tenure
2021-2023:

* Established the joint GC/TC call as an avenue for communication between the
  two groups
* Helped make the project more popular by talking about it at podcasts,
  conferences, and other similar events
* Attended the first in-person OTel leadership summit, discussing current
  challenges to the project and what we can do to overcome them
* Mediated conflicts, with the goal of keeping the OTel community welcoming to
  new members
* Actively proposed, reviewed, and voted on changes to the project
* Coordinated the participation of the OpenTelemetry project in the
  [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) internship programs, successfully
  recruiting mentors among the OpenTelemetry maintainers
* Volunteered to be a sponsor for the SIG Security, taking an active
  participation there
* Connected people from different parts of the community based on the broader
  community view I obtained as being part of the board

As an engineer, I’m active in communities around the SIG Collector, where I’m an
[approver in the
core](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector#contributing)
repository, and [maintainer in the
contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/#contributing)
repository, being the author or code owner for several components, including the
[load-balancing
exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/loadbalancingexporter#trace-idservice-name-aware-load-balancing-exporter)
and [tail-sampling
processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/tailsamplingprocessor#tail-sampling-processor),
which together allow open-source users to achieve a scalable tail-sampling
deployment without getting locked-in with specific vendors. I’m also the creator
of the [OpenTelemetry Operator for
Kubernetes](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator), having
successfully fostered a community around it that is able to continue evolving
further even after I stepped back from maintainership to focus on other OTel
areas. Overall, I’m very proud of my contributions to the project, placing me
among the [top 10
contributors](https://opentelemetry.devstats.cncf.io/d/9/developer-activity-counts-by-repository-group-table?orgId=1&var-period_name=Last%202%20years&var-metric=contributions&var-repogroup_name=All&var-country_name=All)
to the project since the last election.

My commitment to the project and the wider observability community goes beyond
the technical contributions: I was part of the [Program Committee for
several](https://www.credly.com/users/juraci-paixao-krohling/badges) editions of
KubeCon, including North America (2023, 2022, 2021), Europe (2023, 2022, 2021),
and China (2020). I also participated as a speaker or panel member in events
like OTel Unplugged, Observability Day, KubeCon EU and NA, among others. As a
side project, I run [Dose de Telemetria](https://linktr.ee/dosedetelemetria),
where I produce quality and up-to-date content once a week about Observability
and Monitoring with a strong focus on OpenTelemetry in my native language,
Portuguese. Due to my community contributions I have been selected as a [CNCF
Ambassador](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/?_sft_lf-country=de&_sft_lf-expertise=technical&_sft_lf-project=opentelemetry&p=juraci-paixao-krohling)
in 2023.

If re-elected, I will continue to actively contribute, collaborate, foster
collaboration, and drive the project's success. Your vote will enable me to
further advance OpenTelemetry's mission and impact. Similar to last time, my
main focus will be on ensuring that our decisions continue to be compatible with
the interests of the broader open-source observability ecosystem, including
users, developers, projects, and vendors. In addition, I’ll continue
OpenTelemetry’s participation in Outreachy by recruiting maintainers to become
mentors of new interns. My goal is to participate in all Outreachy cohorts for
the next two years.

I'm Eric Sirianni, a technical leader at Confluent focused on Observability.

My team currently operates an OpenTelemetry-based platform that powers several
critical use cases within Confluent Cloud. We run a fleet of over 45,000
OpenTelemetry Collector agents in production, exporting telemetry to both
internal and third-party systems. Our internal metrics pipeline ingests over 6
million datapoints per-second with less than 2 minute lag and serves over 300
queries per-second with sub-second latency.

I introduced OpenTelemetry to Confluent's architecture in 2020 and have since
been evangelizing its adoption across our platform.  I also meet regularly with
our Observability vendors to suggest and advocate OpenTelemetry-related features
on their roadmaps.

Over the past few years, I have been a fairly active participant in the
OpenTelemetry community, primarily engaging in Slack discussions and submitting
bug reports or feature requests.  I've been very impressed with the enthusiasm
and welcoming nature of the OTel community, as well as their openness and
responsiveness to feedback.

If elected, I hope to provide an end user's perspective to the GC and share my
experiences as both an adopter and advocate for OpenTelemetry.

### Severin Neumann

<img src="static/severin-neumann.jpg" alt="Severin Neumann" height="400" width="400">

- Company: [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/)
- GitHub: [svrnm](https://github.com/svrnm)

#### What I'll Do

I have been a software engineer for over 20 years and [published much of my work as open source](https://github.com/svrnm/). Three years ago, [I started contributing to OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/pull/1509) and have since become a [co-maintainer of SIG Communications](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/issues?q=involves%3Asvrnm+sort%3Aupdated-desc). Along this journey, I have learned from best practices, made mistakes, and enjoyed interacting with the fantastic people in the OpenTelemetry community.

Each role in a contributor's journey is crucial to the success of OpenTelemetry and presents its own challenges. If elected to the Governance Committee, my goal, in collaboration with other community leaders such as the Governance Committee, Technical Committee, and maintainers, is to:

- **Lower the barrier for new contributors:** With my experience in leading OpenTelemetry efforts at Cisco, I have successfully encouraged [nearly 100 individuals](https://opentelemetry.devstats.cncf.io/d/66/developer-activity-counts-by-companies?orgId=1&var-period_name=Last%20decade&var-metric=contributions&var-repogroup_name=All&var-country_name=All&var-companies=Cisco) to make contributions. I have learned about the challenges they face and how to address them, such as providing precise guidelines and offering one-on-one assistance. I want to utilize this experience to make it easier for new contributors to get started and become long-term contributors. My goal is to work with the community to identify effective means of lowering the barrier for new contributors and implement them.

- **Help existing contributors advance:** We want and need first-time contributors to stay and become established members of the community. I believe that recognition for contributions plays a key role in retaining contributors. As the OpenTelemetry community grows rapidly, it becomes challenging to keep track of all the great work happening outside of repositories. My goal is to establish means to recognize and reward contributions at a community-wide level and support contributors on their journey to becoming approvers, maintainers, and leaders. This includes addressing the need to properly track and recognize contributions that may not be currently accounted for, such as giving talks, actively participating in SIG calls, or helping in the community forum.

- **Support maintainers:** Maintainers are the backbone of the OpenTelemetry community, often contributing in their spare time. To sustainably fulfill their role, maintainers need to be effective and face minimal friction. I believe that SIGs can learn from each other and share best practices to achieve this. My goal is to uncover these opportunities and provide SIGs with the support they need to be more effective and sustainable. Additionally, I will help to look beyond OpenTelemetry and learn from other successful OSS communities.

- **Drive interaction and integration with the wider OSS community:** It is part of [OpenTelemetry's mission](https://opentelemetry.io/community/mission/#telemetry-should-be-built-in) that _high-quality telemetry should be built in to the entire software stack – just like comments are today_. Therefore, it is crucial to actively engage with the wider OSS community and establish relationships with other projects. Strengthening existing relationships and establishing new ones will help us achieve our shared vision and mission. My goal is to drive the interaction and integration of OpenTelemetry with other OSS projects, to accomplish our shared vision and mission.

#### About Me

I am a co-maintainer of SIG Communication ([Website and Docs](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io)) and focus on providing an easy entry to OpenTelemetry for end-users by leveraging the work of other SIGs. Currently, I am passionate about creating consistency in our documentation to improve maintainability and user experience. For example, I am driving the standardizing of ["Getting Started"](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/issues/2623) guides and sections about ["Manual Instrumentation"](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/issues/3229) across different languages.

At Cisco, I am a member of the [Open Source Program Office](https://opensource.cisco.com) and actively drive an internal community around OpenTelemetry. Over the past two years, this community has grown from a handful of individuals to almost 100 contributors, with [over 12,000 contributions and 900+ merged PRs](https://opentelemetry.devstats.cncf.io/d/5/companies-table?orgId=1).

I have also had the opportunity to speak about OpenTelemetry at [KubeCon EU](https://youtu.be/XvPsdjNrpKo?feature=shared) and at [CloudLand 2023 in Germany](https://en.shop.doag.org/events/cloudland/2023/agenda/#eventDay.all#textSearch.Severin%20Neumann) and participate in the [Program Committee for KubeCon NA](https://www.credly.com/badges/c930d2a0-b88d-4a7f-b4b8-a72d941)

#### Thank You 

Thank you for being part of the awesome OpenTelemetry community!

### Ted Young

- GitHub: [tedsuo](https://github.com/tedsuo)

Hello, I'm one of the OpenTelemetry co-founders. My primary focus has been on
API design, technical project management, and facilitation. For every new project within OpenTelemetry,
my ethos has been to reach out to find new collaborators, give them the support that they need and
set them up for success. When a project is stuck on design, or is missing a designer, then I will also
help bottom line the design work. Examples include the many aspects of the tracing system, context
propagation, error reporting, and our approach to stability/backwards compatibility.

In the past, expanding the scope of OpenTelemetry has felt slow, especially when related to desiging
and accepting new specifications. This perception was related to spreading ourselves too thin, starting
too many new initiatives without first defining timelines, TC sponsors, and responsibilities.

To address this, I've spent this past year developing a new project management workflow for OpenTelemetry,
and we have had success rebooting several SIGs under this new process.

I also facilitate conflict resolution, and I am available to all community members whenever they are
experiencing any difficulty or frustration. In general, I try to keep OpenTelemetry a friendly, drama-free
environment where collaboration is easy and enjoyable.

I would like to continue this work with another term on the GC. This position aligns well with the facilitation
and project management role that I currently perform for the OpenTelemetry community. If my approach to 
community management sounds good to you, please vote for me so that I may continue to help our amazing community
grow and thrive!
