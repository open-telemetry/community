# OpenTelemetry 2019 Governance Committee election

This document lays out the election schedule and process for the OpenTelemetry
governance committee to implement the [charter document][charter] requirements.

In this election there are **four seats** that need to be filled. We strive to
complete the election before KubeCon North America so that there is a good
chance the newly-elected members of the Governance Committee can meet there, in
person, at the conference. The nominees list will be shared October 14th, voting
will take place October 21-23, and the results will be announced October 28th.

We highly encourage participation in this election cycle to ensure that the
community is well-represented by the Governance Committee.

## TL;DR;

- If you‘ve been nominated or are willing to nominate yourself: check the
  [charter document][charter] and confirm you are ready for the commitment. Make
  sure to provide your information by October 9th.
- If you are an active community member: confirm that you are in the voters (see
  [Appendix](#Appendix)).
  lists or register yourself by October 20th.

## Voting process

The current Governance Committee will play the role of the election committee
this year. We strive for transparency in the election process and hold the
interests of the community as our first priority.

### Nominations

As per [charter document][charter], anybody is eligible to run for the board.
During the call for nomination period, people can be nominated or nominate
themselves by sending an email to
[cncf-opentelemetry-governance@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-opentelemetry-governance@lists.cncf.io).
The following information will be collected via email from every nominee:

- Full name
- GitHub alias
- Company affiliation
- Short bio and/or reasoning to join the Governance committee (no more than a
  short paragraph)
- *Optional*: photo/picture of a nominee.
- E-mail *(will not be shared publicly, only used for communication)*

Governance committee or appointed people will contact every nominee directly to
ensure the commitment and desire to be nominated.

### Voter pre-registration

All active GitHub contributors will receive a voting link to the email
associated with their commits. If your code contributions do not meet
eligibility requirements, but you are eligible for voting with the non-code
contributions, you need to pre-register so voting link can be sent.

The form will ask for email and a proof of eligibility for the vote. Criteria
for voting eligibility are listed in the Members of Standing section of the
[charter document][charter].

One of two options will be available in the form to prove eligibility:

- GitHub handle
- List your contributions to OpenTelemetry that make you eligible to vote.

The link to the pre-registration form: https://forms.gle/9aqtXYm9BmZg7tjo9

Note, all pre-registrations will be verified by the Governance Committee for
eligibility.

All pre-registrations are private. Only the members of a current governance
committee will have access to this information. Lists will be discarded one
month after the election.

### Vote

Everyone with voting rights will receive the link to the voting site. [Condorcet
Internet Voting Service](https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/) will be used for the
voting process.

Late registrations for vote and requests to re-send the voting link will be
accepted via email
[cncf-opentelemetry-governance@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-opentelemetry-governance@lists.cncf.io).
We encourage you to pre-register to minimize an effort to run this election.

Voting is private, nobody will know an individual's vote.

### Results

Voting will close on October 23. Nominees will be stack ranked. Topmost nominee
has a choice of term; the default is that the highest-scoring nominees get
two-year terms. If a nominee becomes ineligible (for instance, if more than 2
topmost nominees work for the same company), those nominees will be skipped and
the nominee with the highest score after that will be picked.
