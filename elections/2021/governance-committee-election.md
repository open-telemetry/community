This document lays out the 2021 election process per the OpenTelemetry

# Voting process

The 2021 election process can be tracked via [this GitHub
issue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/812). The election
committee this year consists of governance committee members Alolita Sharma,
Daniel Dyla, and Liz Fong-Jones who are not up for reelection this year.
We strive for transparency in the election process and hold the interests of the
community as our first priority. In particular, we will ensure that all
documents and assets related to the 2021 election process are public, and we
will attempt to record and distribute notes for any meetings held as part of
this process.

# Nominations

As per
[the charter document](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/master/governance-charter.md#establishment-of-a-governance-committee),
anybody is eligible to run for the Governance Committee. During the “call for
nomination” period, people can be nominated or nominate themselves by
submitting a Pull Request adding said candidate to the
[governance-committee-candidates.md](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/master/elections/2021/governance-committee-candidates.md)
file in the OpenTelemetry community repository. The template in that file includes
the following columns:
* Full name
* GitHub alias
* Company affiliation (if applicable)
* Short bio and/or reasoning to join the Governance Committee (no more than a
  short paragraph)
* _Optional_: photo/picture of a nominee

The Pull Request will not be merged until the candidate has confirmed their
desire to be nominated (if not self-nominating) and ratification has occurred
via PR comments.

The email address of the nominee should also be sent to
[cncf-opentelemetry-governance@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-opentelemetry-governance@lists.cncf.io) –
it will be kept private and used only for candidate communications as the
election process proceeds.

The Governance Committee or appointed people will contact every nominee
directly to ensure the commitment and desire to be nominated.

# Voter Eligibility

All [members of standing](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/master/governance-charter.md#members-of-standing)
will automatically be eligible to vote. To confirm your eligibility status,
see the [election announcements issue](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/852). If your code contributions do not meet
eligibility requirements, but you believe your non-code contributions
should make you eligible to vote, you can request an exemption by submitting
an exemption request form here \[outdated link removed\].

One of two options will be available in the form to prove eligibility:

* GitHub handle
* List either…
  * Your contributions to OpenTelemetry that make you eligible to vote, or
  * Your non-code contributions per the [Members of Standing section of the charter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/master/governance-charter.md#members-of-standing):
    particularly, your relationship to a well-known project that’s taken a hard
    dependency on OpenTelemetry, and/or your involvement with a well-known
    organization’s adoption of OpenTelemetry as an end-user.

All exemption forms are private. Only the members of a current governance
committee and election committee will have access to this information. Lists
will be discarded one month after the election.

# Vote

Everyone with voting rights may log into
[Helios Voting](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/bbeab1b8-1406-11ec-b980-eacead3a3158/view)
using their GitHub account.
Voting will be approval voting. Each voter may select up to 5 candidates.
The 5 candidates with the most votes win the election.


Late registrations to vote and requests to re-send the voting link will be
accepted via email to
[cncf-opentelemetry-governance@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-opentelemetry-governance@lists.cncf.io).
We encourage pre-registration to minimize the effort required to run this
election.

Per Helios, voting is completely private: nobody will know any individual's vote.

# Results

Voting will close at 12:01am GMT on 2021/10/28. Nominees will be stack ranked.
