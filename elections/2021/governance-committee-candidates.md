Hi all! OpenTelemetry's mission is a very important one for our industry, and
as such I would be honored to continue to serve on the OTel Governance
Committee. Here I'll try to briefly summarize my history in the space as well
as my priorities for OpenTelemetry over the coming years.

**My history in the space:**

- Google days (2003-2012)
  - Productionized Dapper and published ["The Dapper Paper"](https://research.google/pubs/pub36356/)
    (trivia fact: I
    [coined the term "Span"](https://lightstep.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-the-span-hard-to-love-hard-to-kill/)
    in 2006, for better or worse!)
  - Co-created and productionized [Monarch](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol13/p3181-adams.pdf)
- Lightstep days (2015-present)
  - While at a tracing workshop (along with [Yuri](#Yuri-Shkuro) below), a few
    of us started collaborating and soon co-created
    [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/), one of OpenTelemetry's two "parent"
    projects.
  - I worked hard to rebuild trust between OpenTracing and OpenCensus in 2018
    and 2019 in order to make OpenTelemetry possible – big kudos to everyone
    involved in that process, it was certainly a group effort!
  - I have been a tireless advocate for OpenTracing and now OpenTelemetry, even
    during the early days when everyone from incumbent vendors to Gartner told
    us we were all completely out to lunch. :) What we're all doing here is
    important and greatly beneficial but does require a lot of explanation and
    market education.

**My priorities for OpenTelemetry:**

If elected to another term, these are the things I would prioritize as a member
of the Governance Committee:
- *Greater involvement from OpenTelemetry end-users throughout the
  project:* from planning to prioritization to design iteration.
- *More detailed and more credible roadmaps:* OpenTelemetry is at risk of
  becoming a victim of its own success, with thousands of contributors and many
  constituents with broad priorities. We will benefit from additional planning
  upfront to get alignment on scope and timelines to guide the (excellent) work
  taking place across the project.
- *Scaling our processes and internal structures:* Our maintainers are
  *amazing* yet likely to burn out given the workload. Our contributors are
  also *amazing* yet often frustrated by lengthy delays and other side-effects
  of our scale. By creating more scalable structures and delegation within
  OTel, as a project we will be able to parallelize more effectively while
  helping to mentor the next crop of OTel leaders in the process.
- *Prioritize diversity:* OpenTelemetry is an "average" OSS project from a
  diversity and inclusion standpoint (and the average is not good!). I have
  advocated about this in numerous GC meetings in the past, and with the
  project rounding the bend on maturity I believe it is time to put more
  concerted effort into drawing people with diverse backgrounds into the
  project, at all levels.

### Punya Biswal

- Company: Google
- Github: [punya](https://github.com/punya)


I’ve participated in the OpenTelemetry community for the past year, especially the Go and Collector SIGs. In addition to writing code, I help clarify contentious designs and onboard new contributors. As a [triager](../../community-membership.md#triager) for the collector repository, I help our busy maintainers and contributors to use their time efficiently.

Before getting involved in telemetry, I led teams at small-to-midsize companies that were shipping products and figuring out observability for the first time. I’d like to use the perspective I gained from that experience to advocate for simple designs that are easy for newcomers and small teams to adopt.

If elected to the GC, I’ll work to measure and improve the experience of OTel contributors – for example, looking at how many contributors “give up” on proposals, how long it takes to merge a pull request, or how often our automated tests flake.

- Company: Google
- GitHub: [SergeyKanzhelev](https://github.com/SergeyKanzhelev)

Hi all! I have a long history working on observability and monitoring tools and was involved into OpenCensus and OpenTelemetry projects from their inception. I'm a co-chair of the W3C Distributed Tracing Working Group, which has strong ties to OpenTelemetry. I'm also involved in Kubernetes community which gives me a good perspective on how a different project addresses challenges OpenTelemetry faces. It will be my privilege to continue serving on the Governance Committee.

I strongly believe that the project with such an ambitious mission as OpenTelemetry, with the diverse group of contributors and interested parties, can only succeed if we together will uphold the project values, grow the community, and help everybody in the community grow. This is why as a Governance Committee member my goals are to enable contributors, empower maintainers, keep community welcoming and fair.

### Sharr Creeden

<img src="static/sharr-creeden.jpg" alt="Sharr Creeden photo" height="400" width="400">

- Company: New Relic
- GitHub: [sharrmander](https://github.com/sharrmander)

Hi! For the past year, my primary focus has been improving New Relic’s support for OpenTelemetry informed by partnering with early adopter end-users to plan their OTel based observability strategies. In this capacity, I have successfully championed for New Relic to provide dedicated resources to the project and now I lead our growing OpenTelemetry community team composed of members, approvers, maintainers, and a developer advocate. By establishing this team, I’ve helped grow the OpenTelemetry community too.

I’ve been following the project closely and am inspired by the passion of the contributors and the potential of achieving OpenTelemetry’s mission. I want to contribute to making our shared vision a reality through my unique perspective, cultivated through a career building skills in the business and leadership sides of tech. As a non-developer, I can bring a complementary, but distinctly different background and perspective to the governance committee. I believe that through strong governance and supporting processes, we can build a sustainable community, amplify our advocacy efforts and polish the project to accelerate early majority adoption.

If elected to the governance committee I would prioritize:

- Interacting with members of the community and end-users to understand challenges and celebrate achievements.
- Creating and optimizing processes to improve feedback access and cycle time, especially as they pertain to stories from end-users and experiences of community contributors.
- Helping improve end-user engagement and accessibility of the project by contributing to efforts to improve roadmap visibility, reduce onboarding friction, and improve the example code and documentation.
- Collaborating with members of the governance committee on their platform priorities.

Thank you for your engagement - through both your project contributions and the voting process!

### Ted Young

- Company: Lightstep
- GitHub: [tedsuo](https://github.com/tedsuo)

Hello, I'm one of the OpenTelemetry co-founders . My primary focus has been on
API design, technical project management, and facilitation. For every new project within OpenTelemetry,
my ethos has been to reach out to find new collaborators, give them the support that they need and
set them up for success. When a project is stuck on design, or is missing a designer, then I will also
bottom line the design work.

Examples include the many aspects of the tracing system, context propagation, error reporting, and our
approach to stability/backwards compatibility. Currently, I am focused on the design of semantic conventions
and instrumentation, ensuring that OpenTelemetry consistently produces the highest quality telemetry data
available.

I also facilitate conflict resolution, and I am available to all community members whenever they are experiencing
any difficulty or frustration. In general, I try to keep OpenTelemetry a friendly, drama-free environment
where collaboration is easy.

I've been a member of the OpenTelemetry governance committee for the past two years. This position aligns
well with the facilitation role that I currently perform for the OpenTelemetry community. If my approach to
community management sounds good to you, please vote for me so that I may continue facilitating and growing
our amazing community!

### Yuri Shkuro

- Company: Facebook
- GitHub: [yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro)

Hello. I am one of the co-founders of OpenTelemetry, a member of the original “seed” Governance Committee that was formed by merging OpenTracing and OpenCensus, and a member of OTel Technical Committee. I helped create many of the OTel’s charters and policies. My primary focus is on OTel Specification as a blueprint for developing APIs and SDKs. I am also the founder of the CNCF Jaeger project.

It will be my privilege to continue serving on the Governance Committee. There are several reasons why my candidacy brings unique perspective to the committee:

- I was a co-founder of the OpenTracing project (which is being retired), and I care about OTel continuing to serve the large number of users and companies who previously invested in OpenTracing.
- During the existence of OTel GC, I’ve been the only member who represented an end-user organization rather than a commercial observability/cloud vendor. I think we could use more end-user voices in the project’s leadership.
- I also represent OTel’s partner project Jaeger. Jaeger was the first oss tracing system that embraced vendor-neutral approach to instrumentation via OpenTracing, by developing fully compliant SDKs in multiple languages that followed a single specification while providing novel features like centralized control plane and adaptive sampling. I am happy to see OTel reaching the maturity where we can retire Jaeger’s own SDKs and recommend people to switch to OTel.
- Lastly, specific to tracing domain, I work with one of the few tracing systems in the industry that is not based on span model (like OTel & Jaeger), but on a richer event-based model (cf. Canopy paper).  That, as well as our scale requirements, also gives me a unique perspective on the usability of OTel APIs.
