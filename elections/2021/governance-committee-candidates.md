Hello, I'm one of the OpenTelemetry co-founders . My primary focus has been on
API design, technical project management, and facilitation. For every new project within OpenTelemetry,
my ethos has been to reach out to find new collaborators, give them the support that they need and
set them up for success. When a project is stuck on design, or is missing a designer, then I will also
bottom line the design work.

Examples include the many aspects of the tracing system, context propagation, error reporting, and our
approach to stability/backwards compatibility. Currently, I am focused on the design of semantic conventions
and instrumentation, ensuring that OpenTelemetry consistently produces the highest quality telemetry data
available.

I also facilitate conflict resolution, and I am available to all community members whenever they are experiencing
any difficulty or frustration. In general, I try to keep OpenTelemetry a friendly, drama-free environment
where collaboration is easy.

I've been a member of the OpenTelemetry governance committee for the past two years. This position aligns
well with the facilitation role that I currently perform for the OpenTelemetry community. If my approach to
community management sounds good to you, please vote for me so that I may continue facilitating and growing
our amazing community!
