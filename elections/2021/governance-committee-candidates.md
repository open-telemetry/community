I’ve participated in the OpenTelemetry community for the past year, especially the Go and Collector SIGs. In addition to writing code, I help clarify contentious designs and onboard new contributors. As a [triager](../../community-membership.md#triager) for the collector repository, I help our busy maintainers and contributors to use their time efficiently.

Before getting involved in telemetry, I led teams at small-to-midsize companies that were shipping products and figuring out observability for the first time. I’d like to use the perspective I gained from that experience to advocate for simple designs that are easy for newcomers and small teams to adopt.

If elected to the GC, I’ll work to measure and improve the experience of OTel contributors – for example, looking at how many contributors “give up” on proposals, how long it takes to merge a pull request, or how often our automated tests flake.

Hi! I'm an [Engineering Director](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steveflanders/)
at Splunk and lead the Observability “Getting Data In” team which contributes
extensively to OpenTelemetry. I have been in the monitoring/observability space
for over a decade and involved in both the OpenCensus and OpenTelemetry
projects from the beginning. I am proud to be part of the incredible
OpenTelemetry community and appreciate your consideration and vote!

#### How I contribute

I helped co-create the OpenCensus Sevice and OpenTelemetry Collector with
involvement from software development and architecture to product management
and roadmap. Across many OpenTelemetry repositories I spend a lot of time on
getting started, documentation, and examples. I also help promote and teach
people about OpenTelemetry via conference talks, workshops, and blog posts. I
authored the [OpenTelemetry incubation
document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f4WQR6K84giyOCKjCsqcoVA8YUIzBhWZDVo3CwM1wuk/edit#heading=h.wrbwe8x26bft)
and presented it to TAG Observability.

#### My Values

- Community, diversity, and positivity; recognize and appreciate everyone
- Listen, share, learn, grow, and laugh; focus on openness and collaboration
- Prioritize ease of use and customer experience always

#### Why I'm Running

- Continue to build a positive community where opinions are heard and valued
- Help prioritize and drive customer adoption and case studies
- Ensure the best documentation with getting started guides and demos

### Ted Young

Hello, I'm one of the OpenTelemetry co-founders . My primary focus has been on
API design, technical project management, and facilitation. For every new project within OpenTelemetry,
my ethos has been to reach out to find new collaborators, give them the support that they need and
set them up for success. When a project is stuck on design, or is missing a designer, then I will also
bottom line the design work.

Examples include the many aspects of the tracing system, context propagation, error reporting, and our
approach to stability/backwards compatibility. Currently, I am focused on the design of semantic conventions
and instrumentation, ensuring that OpenTelemetry consistently produces the highest quality telemetry data
available.

I also facilitate conflict resolution, and I am available to all community members whenever they are experiencing
any difficulty or frustration. In general, I try to keep OpenTelemetry a friendly, drama-free environment
where collaboration is easy.

I've been a member of the OpenTelemetry governance committee for the past two years. This position aligns
well with the facilitation role that I currently perform for the OpenTelemetry community. If my approach to
community management sounds good to you, please vote for me so that I may continue facilitating and growing
our amazing community!

### Yuri Shkuro

Hello. I am one of the co-founders of OpenTelemetry, a member of the original “seed” Governance Committee that was formed by merging OpenTracing and OpenCensus, and a member of OTel Technical Committee. I helped create many of the OTel’s charters and policies. My primary focus is on OTel Specification as a blueprint for developing APIs and SDKs. I am also the founder of the CNCF Jaeger project.

It will be my privilege to continue serving on the Governance Committee. There are several reasons why my candidacy brings unique perspective to the committee:

- I was a co-founder of the OpenTracing project (which is being retired), and I care about OTel continuing to serve the large number of users and companies who previously invested in OpenTracing.
- During the existence of OTel GC, I’ve been the only member who represented an end-user organization rather than a commercial observability/cloud vendor. I think we could use more end-user voices in the project’s leadership.
- I also represent OTel’s partner project Jaeger. Jaeger was the first oss tracing system that embraced vendor-neutral approach to instrumentation via OpenTracing, by developing fully compliant SDKs in multiple languages that followed a single specification while providing novel features like centralized control plane and adaptive sampling. I am happy to see OTel reaching the maturity where we can retire Jaeger’s own SDKs and recommend people to switch to OTel.
- Lastly, specific to tracing domain, I work with one of the few tracing systems in the industry that is not based on span model (like OTel & Jaeger), but on a richer event-based model (cf. Canopy paper).  That, as well as our scale requirements, also gives me a unique perspective on the usability of OTel APIs.
