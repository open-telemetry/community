Statement

I believe Open Telemetry (OTel) represents the future of open observability. It embodies standardization, interoperability and growing commitment by all key stakeholders in computing infrastructure and services. 

As a project contributor and member of the OTel governance committee, I will push for native support of OpenTelemetry in Kubernetes for all telemetry signals. I also will contribute to features important for wider adoption of OTel such as instrumentation, smart configuration management, real user monitoring, and profiling.

Some of my key accomplishments on OpenTelemetry over the last four years include: 
* I‚Äôve helped the Collector project prioritize features for tracing and metrics stability, triaging issues, and maintaining GitHub project boards. 
* I added over 100 engineers, including women engineers, from multiple teams at AWS to contribute to the Collector and language libraries. 
* I helped OTel achieve incubation status by leading the graduation review process from sandbox to incubation with the CNCF TOC and the Observability TAG. 
* I‚Äôve helped ensure maintainer diversity for the Collector, and language libraries including C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, .Net, PHP, and Python.
* I‚Äôve actively mentored teams from companies like Cisco/AppDynamics, New Relic, and Atlassian to contribute to OTel.  
* I created the Prometheus-OpenMetrics-OpenTelemetry interoperability workgroup to deliver OTel metrics stability.
* I collaborated with the Prometheus project to codify the Prometheus remote-write (push) specification and compliance requirements.  
* I introduced OTel enhancement proposals (OTEPs) for real time monitoring (RUM) and Elastic Common Schema (ECS) logging. 
* I led the development of GitHub Actions CI/CD and security workflows for OTel‚Äôs language libraries. 

While at AWS, for more than three years I led observability strategy and engineering for OpenTelemetry and created ‚ÄúAWS Distro for OpenTelemetry‚Äù - an OTel infrastructure and services distribution. 

Today at Apple, I lead observability for Siri and other AI services. I‚Äôm a contributor to OTel and a member of the current OTel governance committee. I serve as co-chair of the CNCF Observability Technical Advisory Group (TAG) and also contribute to other open source observability projects including Prometheus, OpenMetrics, Cortex and Grafana. I‚Äôm passionate about open source collaboration, have contributed to several open source initiatives and have served on open source organization boards including OSI, SFLC.in and the Unicode Consortium. I‚Äôve presented at international conferences including Kubecon, ApacheCon, Open Source Summit, TED and other venues.

So, now at Apple and running for a second term on the governance committee, I want to continue my contributions to the project and leverage the immense resources and reach of a key stakeholder, adopter and end-user.

I look forward to your vote so that we together can continue to create great progress in OpenTelemetry. 

Thank you for your support. üôè

### Reiley Yang

<img src="static/reiley-yang.jpeg" alt="Reiley Yang" height="400" width="400">

- Company: [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/)
- GitHub: [reyang](https://github.com/reyang)

Hi, I am a member of the OpenTelemetry Technical Committee, emeritus maintainer
of OpenTelemetry C++ and Python, and approver of OpenTelemetry C++,
OpenTelemetry .NET and OpenTelemetry Demo.

I began to influence the telemetry industry since year 2017, as the maintainer
of OpenCensus Python and [was
acknowledged](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#acknowledgments) for the
contribution to the W3C TraceContext standard, including the design of the
widely used [test harness and
suite](https://github.com/w3c/trace-context/tree/main/test), which has been
adopted by many OpenTelemetry SIGs and vendors to validate their conformance to
the TraceContext specification.

Being one of the very initial members of OpenTelemetry, I helped to incubate and
unblock several projects:

- I was the initial maintainer who helped to kick off the OpenTelemetry Python
  SIG back in Jun. 2019. After the project started to run smoothly and reached
  beta, I stepped back as an emeritus maintainer.
- I started the OpenTelemetry C++ project as an initial maintainer back in Oct.
  2019, helped to ramp up the SIG, got the initial project set up, and attracted
  other developers from the community. I guided more than 10 developers and
  interns to deliver the metrics and logging prototype in 2020. I also sponsored
  two developers from Microsoft and eventually grew both of them to maintainers.
- I started to help the OpenTelemetry .NET project, after noticing it was
  blocked and has not seen breakthrough for almost a year. Starting from
  mid-2020, the project turned over and quickly reached Release Candidate in
  late 2020, followed by the 1.0 Stable release in early 2021. I remain active
  as an approver of the project.
- I helped to found the OpenTelemetry Demo workstream and turned it into a
  successful project.

As a Technical Committee member, I also oversee the project from the design,
specification and process perspective. Including defining the issue triage
process to unblock the trace and metrics release, facilitating the metrics
API/SDK specification stabilization, improving the workflow to unblock several
workstreams, encouraging the collaboration between OpenTelemetry community and
other open-source communities.

If elected, I would like to spend more energy on attracting talents, improving
our collaboration efficiency and helping members to grow so we can achieve more
as a community.

those challenges, are passionate contributors and enthusiastic end-users:
contributors make sure that OpenTelemetry flourishes and happy end-users spread
the word about it.

Being passionate about a happy community, my own mission so far is to improve
the ease of use of OpenTelemetry via my contributions
(e.g. by [writing documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/issues?q=author%3Asvrnm))
and to encourage as many people as possible within Cisco to contribute to
the OpenTelemetry projects: [I support 60 individuals](https://opentelemetry.devstats.cncf.io/d/66/developer-activity-counts-by-companies?orgId=1&var-period_name=Last%20year&var-metric=contributions&var-repogroup_name=All&var-country_name=All&var-companies=Cisco)
on their journey to from their first issue/PR to being an active member
of the community.

I would be honored to be elected by you into the Governance Committee and
to expand my mission to the whole project. 

If elected, ...
- ... I want to stretch my support to the whole community and encourage new-comers
  everywhere to become and stay active members of the community.

Hi! I have been in the observability/monitoring space for a decade+, the past three years as a maintainer of the
OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation project, and before that as author and maintainer of an open source Java APM tool
[Glowroot](https://glowroot.org).

I have helped build the OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation community into one that "is welcoming, supportive, and
inclusive, more than any other I've contributed to" ([@lmolkova](https://github.com/lmolkova)). It is also the
[most active repository](https://opentelemetry.devstats.cncf.io/d/1/activity-repository-groups?orgId=1&var-period=y&var-repogroups=All&from=now-5y&to=now)
outside of the Collector and Collector Contrib repositories.

As a member of the OpenTelemetry Governance Committee, I would like to shift my focus within the community for the next
two years to focus on the health across all repositories and their respective contributor communities.

I believe there is a lot we can learn from each other across repositories and I would like to focus on driving these
discussions to identify best practices and concrete actions we can take to improve experiences for everyone,
from first-time contributors to long-time maintainers.

And as [one of the most active](https://opentelemetry.devstats.cncf.io/d/9/developer-activity-counts-by-repository-group-table?orgId=1)
contributors to OpenTelemetry, I believe I have the time, commitment, and support from my employer to take this on.

Thanks :heart:
