Observability is an important area for our company and OpenTelemetry serves as a standard in the field of observability, it has a high penetration rate in China. I have a long history working on observability team/product in DaoCloud and seeing it grow. Therefore, I would be happy to promote and evangelize Opentelemrtry technology in China to help the community make OpenTelemetry better.
I'm also a Project Management Committee (PMC) member of [Apache Skywalking](https://github.com/apache/skywalking), which helped me accumulate a lot of experience in APM and community governance.
