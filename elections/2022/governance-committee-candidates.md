### Severin Neumann

![Severin Neumann](static/severin-neumann.jpg)

- Company: [Cisco AppDynamics](https://www.appdynamics.com)
- Github: [svrnm](https://github.com/svrnm)

My name is Severin Neumann and I am based out of Germany. I am a maintainer in
the Communication SIG (Website, Docs). I have been doing software development
for 20 years. I have been a pre-sales engineer in the APM space for 6 years,
before I started working as Product Manager with a focus on OpenTelemetry at
Cisco/AppDynamics. I feel that I have an unusual combination of customer
background, vendor support, open source passion, development experience,
sales and ability to execute.

**Why I am running**

OTel’s mission to **enable effective observability by making high-quality**,
**portable telemetry ubiquitous** is a bold undertaking that changed how users
get insights into their code. This change is accelerating and there are plenty
of opportunities and challenges ahead!

I believe that, what we need to seize those opportunities and to tackle
those challenges, are passionate contributors and enthusiastic end-users:
contributors make sure that OpenTelemetry flourishes and happy end-users spread
the word about it.

Being passionate about a happy community, my own mission so far is to improve
the ease of use of OpenTelemetry via my contributions
(e.g. by [writing documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/issues?q=author%3Asvrnm))
and to encourage as many people as possible within Cisco to contribute to
the OpenTelemetry projects: [I support 60 individuals](https://opentelemetry.devstats.cncf.io/d/66/developer-activity-counts-by-companies?orgId=1&var-period_name=Last%20year&var-metric=contributions&var-repogroup_name=All&var-country_name=All&var-companies=Cisco)
on their journey to from their first issue/PR to being an active member
of the community.

I would be honored to be elected by you into the Governance Committee and
to expand my mission to the whole project. 

If elected, ...
- ... I want to stretch my support to the whole community and encourage new-comers
  everywhere to become and stay active members of the community.
- ... I want to continue to improve the ease of use of OpenTelemetry and with that
  make sure that new end-users have a great first experience with OpenTelemetry.
- ... I want to work with the members of the GC & TC to foster our community and
  support you to stay a passionate contributor and a happy end-users for the
  years to come.

### Trask Stalnaker

![Trask Stalnaker](static/trask-stalnaker.png)

- Company: [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/)
- GitHub: [trask](https://github.com/trask)

Hi! I have been in the observability/monitoring space for a decade+, the past three years as a maintainer of the
OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation project, and before that as author and maintainer of an open source Java APM tool
[Glowroot](https://glowroot.org).

I have helped build the OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation community into one that "is welcoming, supportive, and
inclusive, more than any other I've contributed to" ([@lmolkova](https://github.com/lmolkova)). It is also the
[most active repository](https://opentelemetry.devstats.cncf.io/d/1/activity-repository-groups?orgId=1&var-period=y&var-repogroups=All&from=now-5y&to=now)
outside of the Collector and Collector Contrib repositories.

As a member of the OpenTelemetry Governance Committee, I would like to shift my focus within the community for the next
two years to focus on the health across all repositories and their respective contributor communities.

I believe there is a lot we can learn from each other across repositories and I would like to focus on driving these
discussions to identify best practices and concrete actions we can take to improve experiences for everyone,
from first-time contributors to long-time maintainers.

And as [one of the most active](https://opentelemetry.devstats.cncf.io/d/9/developer-activity-counts-by-repository-group-table?orgId=1)
contributors to OpenTelemetry, I believe I have the time, commitment, and support from my employer to take this on.

Thanks :heart:

Hi all!
OpenTelemetry is in the process of transforming our industry.
It has been an privilege to help progress this work over the past three years of my involvement with the project, and it would be an honor to help further by serving on the OTel Governance Committee.

I have been a contributor and maintainer of the OpenTelemetry Go project for thee years.
During that time, I have ...

- Run weekly SIG meetings and help promote a welcoming and respectful community
- Managed and delivered project milestones, including the release of the stable tracing API and SDK
- Acted as a founding member of the metric specification and helped release it as stable specification
- Lead the start of the OpenTelemetry Go auto-instrumentation SIG

As a member of the OpenTelemetry Governance Committee I plan to prioritize:

- *Strengthening our communities:* we need to ensure we are supporting structures, policy, and practices that help long-time maintainers as well as first-time contributors. [As an active contributor](https://opentelemetry.devstats.cncf.io/d/9/developer-activity-counts-by-repository-group-table?orgId=1) to the project, I know first-hand how frustrating things can be. I also know many groups grown and solved these frustrations across the project. I plan to help facilitate the spread of these good ideas project wide and in doing so build up our communities.
- *Building user confidence:* OpenTelemetry has accomplish a lot! In the next leg of OTels journey, we need to inspire confidence in our users. I plan to work on formalizing and effectively communicating our project's roadmap to help inspire this confidence.
