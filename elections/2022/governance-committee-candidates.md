Statement

I believe Open Telemetry (OTel) represents the future of open observability. It embodies standardization, interoperability and growing commitment by all key stakeholders in computing infrastructure and services. 

As a project contributor and member of the OTel governance committee, I will push for native support of OpenTelemetry in Kubernetes for all telemetry signals. I also will contribute to features important for wider adoption of OTel such as instrumentation, smart configuration management, real user monitoring, and profiling.

Some of my key accomplishments on OpenTelemetry over the last four years include: 
* I‚Äôve helped the Collector project prioritize features for tracing and metrics stability, triaging issues, and maintaining GitHub project boards. 
* I added over 100 engineers, including women engineers, from multiple teams at AWS to contribute to the Collector and language libraries. 
* I helped OTel achieve incubation status by leading the graduation review process from sandbox to incubation with the CNCF TOC and the Observability TAG. 
* I‚Äôve helped ensure maintainer diversity for the Collector, and language libraries including C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, .Net, PHP, and Python.
* I‚Äôve actively mentored teams from companies like Cisco/AppDynamics, New Relic, and Atlassian to contribute to OTel.  
* I created the Prometheus-OpenMetrics-OpenTelemetry interoperability workgroup to deliver OTel metrics stability.
* I collaborated with the Prometheus project to codify the Prometheus remote-write (push) specification and compliance requirements.  
* I introduced OTel enhancement proposals (OTEPs) for real time monitoring (RUM) and Elastic Common Schema (ECS) logging. 
* I led the development of GitHub Actions CI/CD and security workflows for OTel‚Äôs language libraries. 

While at AWS, for more than three years I led observability strategy and engineering for OpenTelemetry and created ‚ÄúAWS Distro for OpenTelemetry‚Äù - an OTel infrastructure and services distribution. 

Today at Apple, I lead observability for Siri and other AI services. I‚Äôm a contributor to OTel and a member of the current OTel governance committee. I serve as co-chair of the CNCF Observability Technical Advisory Group (TAG) and also contribute to other open source observability projects including Prometheus, OpenMetrics, Cortex and Grafana. I‚Äôm passionate about open source collaboration, have contributed to several open source initiatives and have served on open source organization boards including OSI, SFLC.in and the Unicode Consortium. I‚Äôve presented at international conferences including Kubecon, ApacheCon, Open Source Summit, TED and other venues.

So, now at Apple and running for a second term on the governance committee, I want to continue my contributions to the project and leverage the immense resources and reach of a key stakeholder, adopter and end-user.

I look forward to your vote so that we together can continue to create great progress in OpenTelemetry. 

Thank you for your support. üôè

Hello! My name is Reese Lee, and I am a Developer Relations Engineer on the OpenTelemetry team at New Relic. Initially, I checked out a few different SIGs, but ultimately found that my primary area of interest lay in the End User Working Group ‚Äì after all, what would this project be without end users? To that end, the majority of my contributions to this project thus far have been centered around end user enablement and engagement:

- Co-organizer for the [OpenTelemetry End User Discussion Group](https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2022/new-end-user-resources/#monthly-discussion-group)
- One of the primary contacts for the private #otel-endusers CNCF Slack channel (send me a message to be added!)
- Co-organizer for [OTel Unplugged Day](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/otel-unplugged-kubeconcloudnativecon-detroit-2022-tickets-427595037267), an event for the OpenTelemetry community taking place during KubeCon NA (P.S. Please attend!) 
- Talks and blog posts on OpenTelemetry enablement:
  - [Tail-Based Sampling in the OpenTelemetry Collector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4PeclHKl7I) - KubeCon EU talk
  - [CNCF Live Webinar: OTel Me All About OpenTelemetry](https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-cncf-online-programs-presents-cncf-live-webinar-otel-me-all-about-opentelemetry/)
  - [Tail Sampling with OpenTelemetry: Why it's useful, how to do it, and what to consider](https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2022/tail-sampling/) - OpenTelemetry.io blog post
  - [Where the Heck are my Spans: An OpenTelemetry Mystery](https://vi.to/hubs/o11yfest/videos/5088) - o11yFest talk
  - [Lightning Talk: OTel Me How to Build a Data Pipeline for Observability](https://sched.co/1Avqa) - Upcoming lightning talk at Open Observability Day, a co-located event for KubeCon NA 2022

If elected, my planned areas of action will pertain to:

- Increasing end user engagement, particularly among those newer to observability and development
- Improving end user enablement, in part by contributing more talks and blog posts myself as well as engaging others to do so
- Improving the end user experience as it relates to adoption, usage, and navigating the community and project

‚Ä¶with the end goal of ultimately increasing adoption and usage of OpenTelemetry, and thus improving the project and open source observability as a whole.

**portable telemetry ubiquitous** is a bold undertaking that changed how users
get insights into their code. This change is accelerating and there are plenty
of opportunities and challenges ahead!

I believe that, what we need to seize those opportunities and to tackle
those challenges, are passionate contributors and enthusiastic end-users:
contributors make sure that OpenTelemetry flourishes and happy end-users spread
the word about it.

Being passionate about a happy community, my own mission so far is to improve
the ease of use of OpenTelemetry via my contributions
(e.g. by [writing documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/issues?q=author%3Asvrnm))
and to encourage as many people as possible within Cisco to contribute to
the OpenTelemetry projects: [I support 60 individuals](https://opentelemetry.devstats.cncf.io/d/66/developer-activity-counts-by-companies?orgId=1&var-period_name=Last%20year&var-metric=contributions&var-repogroup_name=All&var-country_name=All&var-companies=Cisco)
on their journey to from their first issue/PR to being an active member
of the community.

I would be honored to be elected by you into the Governance Committee and
to expand my mission to the whole project. 

If elected, ...
- ... I want to stretch my support to the whole community and encourage new-comers
  everywhere to become and stay active members of the community.

### Trask Stalnaker

![Trask Stalnaker](static/trask-stalnaker.png)

- Company: [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/)
- GitHub: [trask](https://github.com/trask)

Hi! I have been in the observability/monitoring space for a decade+, the past three years as a maintainer of the
OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation project, and before that as author and maintainer of an open source Java APM tool
[Glowroot](https://glowroot.org).

I have helped build the OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation community into one that "is welcoming, supportive, and
inclusive, more than any other I've contributed to" ([@lmolkova](https://github.com/lmolkova)). It is also the
[most active repository](https://opentelemetry.devstats.cncf.io/d/1/activity-repository-groups?orgId=1&var-period=y&var-repogroups=All&from=now-5y&to=now)
outside of the Collector and Collector Contrib repositories.

As a member of the OpenTelemetry Governance Committee, I would like to shift my focus within the community for the next
two years to focus on the health across all repositories and their respective contributor communities.

I believe there is a lot we can learn from each other across repositories and I would like to focus on driving these
discussions to identify best practices and concrete actions we can take to improve experiences for everyone,
from first-time contributors to long-time maintainers.

And as [one of the most active](https://opentelemetry.devstats.cncf.io/d/9/developer-activity-counts-by-repository-group-table?orgId=1)
contributors to OpenTelemetry, I believe I have the time, commitment, and support from my employer to take this on.

Thanks :heart:

Hi all!
OpenTelemetry is in the process of transforming our industry.
It has been an privilege to help progress this work over the past three years of my involvement with the project, and it would be an honor to help further by serving on the OTel Governance Committee.

I have been a contributor and maintainer of the OpenTelemetry Go project for thee years.
During that time, I have ...

- Run weekly SIG meetings and help promote a welcoming and respectful community
- Managed and delivered project milestones, including the release of the stable tracing API and SDK
- Acted as a founding member of the metric specification and helped release it as stable specification
- Lead the start of the OpenTelemetry Go auto-instrumentation SIG

As a member of the OpenTelemetry Governance Committee I plan to prioritize:

- *Strengthening our communities:* we need to ensure we are supporting structures, policy, and practices that help long-time maintainers as well as first-time contributors. [As an active contributor](https://opentelemetry.devstats.cncf.io/d/9/developer-activity-counts-by-repository-group-table?orgId=1) to the project, I know first-hand how frustrating things can be. I also know many groups grown and solved these frustrations across the project. I plan to help facilitate the spread of these good ideas project wide and in doing so build up our communities.
- *Building user confidence:* OpenTelemetry has accomplish a lot! In the next leg of OTels journey, we need to inspire confidence in our users. I plan to work on formalizing and effectively communicating our project's roadmap to help inspire this confidence.
