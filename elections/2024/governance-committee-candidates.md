I'm Marylia Gutierrez, a dedicated software engineer with a deep passion for open source and observability, backed by several years of hands-on experience in the industry. I currently contribute to OpenTelemetry as part of my role at Grafana, providing me the focus and flexibility to dedicate substantial time and energy to the Governance Committee. I was able to quickly establish myself as a valuable member of the OpenTelemetry community and currently have been active in the following projects:
- **Contributor Experience**, Maintainer
- **JS SDK**, Triager
    - Including owning the Postgres Plugin
- **Documentation**, Approver for Portuguese Content
- **Database Client Semantic Conventions**

My passion for advocacy extends beyond code. I regularly create and share content about OpenTelemetry and Observability, in both English and Portuguese, through my personal [website](http://marylia.dev) and public talks ([DevOpsDays Fortaleza](https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-fortaleza/program/marylia-gutierrez), [DevOpsDays Recife](https://devopsdays.org/events/2022-recife/program/marylia-gutierrez), [Grafana Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/grafana-and-friends-toronto/events/302979625/?eventOrigin=group_events_list), [CNCF Meetup](https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-toronto-presents-october-toronto-cncf-meetup-end-user-stories/)) I have also welcomed and mentored several newcomers to the area, including via [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) internships as part of the [CNCF Tracing](https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/cncf-tracing/) community. 

I bring a combination of perspectives to the Governance Committee: not only as a contributor to the OpenTelemetry project but also from my previous roles managing observability teams at Cockroach Labs and developing internal observability tools at IBM. These experiences have given me a rich understanding of the end-user journey with observability tools.

As a member of the Governance Committee, my focus will be to foster inclusivity and contributor success. My direct involvement with various SIGs will enable me to channel their needs and ensure that our contributor experience strategy remains focused on growing a diverse and engaged community. By joining the Governance Committee I will be in a unique position to amplify my advocacy efforts, driving strategic initiatives to expand our reach and directly influence the onboarding process for new contributors and users of OpenTelemetry.

I am committed to ensuring OpenTelemetry remains a thriving, inclusive project, and I believe my experience, leadership, and advocacy will help me contribute effectively to the Governance Committeeâ€™s mission.

Thank you for your support!
