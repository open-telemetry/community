### Marylia Gutierrez

- Company: [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com)

I'm Marylia Gutierrez, a dedicated software engineer with a deep passion for open source and observability, backed by several years of hands-on experience in the industry. I currently contribute to OpenTelemetry as part of my role at Grafana, providing me the focus and flexibility to dedicate substantial time and energy to the Governance Committee. I was able to quickly establish myself as a valuable member of the OpenTelemetry community and currently have been active in the following projects:
- **Contributor Experience**, Maintainer
- **JS SDK**, Triager
    - Including owning the Postgres Plugin
- **Documentation**, Approver for Portuguese Content
- **Database Client Semantic Conventions**

My passion for advocacy extends beyond code. I regularly create and share content about OpenTelemetry and Observability, in both English and Portuguese, through my personal [website](http://marylia.dev) and public talks ([DevOpsDays Fortaleza](https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-fortaleza/program/marylia-gutierrez), [DevOpsDays Recife](https://devopsdays.org/events/2022-recife/program/marylia-gutierrez), [Grafana Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/grafana-and-friends-toronto/events/302979625/?eventOrigin=group_events_list), [CNCF Meetup](https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-toronto-presents-october-toronto-cncf-meetup-end-user-stories/)) I have also welcomed and mentored several newcomers to the area, including via [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) internships as part of the [CNCF Tracing](https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/cncf-tracing/) community. 

I bring a combination of perspectives to the Governance Committee: not only as a contributor to the OpenTelemetry project but also from my previous roles managing observability teams at Cockroach Labs and developing internal observability tools at IBM. These experiences have given me a rich understanding of the end-user journey with observability tools.

As a member of the Governance Committee, my focus will be to foster inclusivity and contributor success. My direct involvement with various SIGs will enable me to channel their needs and ensure that our contributor experience strategy remains focused on growing a diverse and engaged community. By joining the Governance Committee I will be in a unique position to amplify my advocacy efforts, driving strategic initiatives to expand our reach and directly influence the onboarding process for new contributors and users of OpenTelemetry.

I am committed to ensuring OpenTelemetry remains a thriving, inclusive project, and I believe my experience, leadership, and advocacy will help me contribute effectively to the Governance Committee’s mission.

Thank you for your support!

### Morgan McLean
![morgan-mclean](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62afbaec-4af1-4cf4-8287-ae19d8ce8528)

- Company: [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/observability.html) / Cisco
- GitHub: [mtwo](https://github.com/mtwo)

Morgan is one of the co-founders of OpenTelemetry and W3C Trace Context, and he currently serves on the Governance Committee. He was instrumental in the creation of OpenTelemetry and assembling and focusing its earliest contributors, and his work continues to have a broad impact on the project:

- Oversaw the final drives towards the **beta and GA releases of both traces and metrics**
- **Proposed and co-led the [addition of logs as a new OpenTelemetry signal]([url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1KZwfLr2PQ&t=26s))**
- **Created the profiling SIG** to add profiles as a new OpenTelemetry signal, brought new members into the community to lead it, and managed the acceptance of the Elastic profiling agent to OpenTelemetry
- **Runs the weekly maintainers check-in** and contributes to various SIGs, including profiles and .Net
- **Created the OpenTelemetry Observatory** at Kubecon, which serves as a space for contributors to work together in person, and for new people to learn more about the project and get introduced to the community

Morgan’s work on the governance committee has focused on everything from moderating and participating in technical discussions, to community outreach and organizing the project’s presence at Kubecon, driving the project towards release milestones, and more. If re-elected, he will focus on the release of profiling as a first-class signal, the implementation of OpAMP agent management support within the Collector and other OpenTelemetry components, and making the getting started process as simple as possible.

At Splunk, Morgan is responsible for much of the Observability Cloud platform, where he oversees Splunk's contributions to and adoption of OpenTelemetry. He previously worked on high-scale observability systems at Google, where he co-created and grew OpenCensus, OpenTelemetry, and the W3C TraceContext specification, and brought partners like Microsoft and Dynatrace into these projects. Prior to that he developed and operated high-scale e-commerce systems at Microsoft and developed high-performance client code at Microsoft and BioWare.
