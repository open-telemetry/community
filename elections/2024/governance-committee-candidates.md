I'm Adriana Villela, and I have been involved with OpenTelemetry since 2022. I am one of the maintainers of the OTel End User SIG, and I am also a CNCF Ambassador. I have been an early proponent of OpenTelemetry, since my days of working as a manager of the Observability Practices team at Tucows, where I convinced the entire organization of the importance of OpenTelemetry adoption before traces even went GA. I am a firm believer of this project and strive to contribute wherever I can - whether it's finding speakers for the End User SIG's [OTel in Practice](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVYDBkQ1TdyxKgdGE4ThYLkNRCuLLYy9x&si=T6BMcqg09zik89OR) and [OTel Q&A](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVYDBkQ1TdywIl9xKEo5_u7zlwY38dW43&si=aS53NEobEZ-f-HfK), collaborating with other SIGs to gather [user feedback](https://github.com/open-telemetry/sig-end-user/tree/main/end-user-surveysx), [documentation contributions](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aopen-telemetry+avillela&type=pullrequests) (e.g. helping to make the OTel Operator more accessible), blog posts on the OTel blog, [my Medium blog](https://adri-v.medium.com/list/opentelemetry-92f897d8b31e), [my podcast])(https://youtube.com/@geekingout_pod), and [giving talks at conferences](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2n5EpcOFZftDkMOL18RVKETHWTrvcKOD&si=mWd1-QNZWLIUoxFv) like KubeCon and Open Source Summit. I am committed to the OpenTelemetry project. One of my favourite aspects of the project is the community. Members are thoughtful, polite, and encouraging, providing a safe space to contribute, especially when it comes to feedback on things like pull requests, which is why I am always inspired to keep on contributing. I want to help keep that thoughtfulness and psychological safety alive.

- Company: [Apple](https://www.apple.com/)  
- GitHub: [alolita](https://github.com/alolita)  
- Personal Website: [alolitasharma.com](http://alolitasharma.com/)

Hi! Please allow me to introduce myself. I am a CNCF Governing Board member where I‚Äôm an undistracted and passionate contributor to open source and open standards. I also chair the CNCF End User Technical Advisory Board (TAB) and co-chair the Observability TAG. For the past 4 years, I‚Äôve been a member of the OpenTelemetry GC. I‚Äôve also served on the boards of the OSI and the Unicode Consortium. In my day job, I lead the AIML observability team at Apple. With little regard for sleep, I‚Äôve led observability and search teams at AWS and have managed engineering teams at IBM, PayPal, Twitter and Wikipedia.

As a seasoned leader in observability and open source, I understand the superpower of collaboration and driving consensus. With a proven track record at industry giants like Apple, AWS, and IBM, I bring a deep understanding of the critical role observability plays in modern software development. If re-elected to the OTel GC, I will continue to drive OTel to be the de-facto observability standard that empowers observability everywhere.

Here are some of my key accomplishments:

* **CNCF Leadership:** Serving on the CNCF Governing Board, on the End User TAB, and co-chairing the Observability TAG, I've been instrumental in shaping the future of open observability standards.  
* **OpenTelemetry Growth:** Over the past six years, I've played a pivotal role in fostering OTel's development. My key achievements include driving OTel metrics feature stability to achieve GA status, launching new SIGs for GenAI LLM Semantic Conventions, for OTel for Mainframes and for End Users. I‚Äôve also promoted community engagement by establishing regular check-ins with maintainers from existing SIGs for Swift, Prometheus Interoperability, and GenAI LLM.  
* **Industry Influence:** As a keynote speaker, I've been a vocal advocate for OTel. As an author, I recently wrote a foreword for the book "Learning OpenTelemetry" by Ted Young and Austin Parker. I‚Äôve mentored observability leaders from industry giants like Apple, Adobe, JPMorgan and Capital One and have fostered OTel collaboration among major cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, Azure and Alibaba Cloud.

If re-elected to the OTel GC, I will prioritize the following:

1. **Graduation:** Accelerate OTel's transition to a graduated CNCF project, cementing its status as a foundational technology.  
2. **Feature Completeness:** Ensure OTel supports essential features for metrics, logs and traces across various SDKs, while also embracing AI semantic conventions for future-proofing.  
3. **Community Growth:** Foster broader global participation in the OTel community to promote collaboration and knowledge sharing.

Join me in shaping the future of OpenTelemetry. Together, we can build a robust observability platform for everyone. Cast your ballot on October 21-23. Thank you for your support. üôè

![Daniel Dyla](static/daniel-dyla.jpg)

- Company: [Dynatrace](https://dynatrace.com)
- GitHub: [dyladan](https://github.com/dyladan)

I'm Daniel Dyla. I've been a [GC member](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/community-members.md#governance-committee) for 4 years, maintainer of [OpenTelemetry JS](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js?tab=readme-ov-file#maintainers-open-telemetryjavascript-maintainers) and contributor to the specification for 5 years, and was recently named a [specification sponsor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/community-members.md#specifications-and-proto) by the Technical Committee in recognition of my contributions. I have contributed to primarily to governance, tracing, metrics, and instrumentation, but have also been involved in logs/events, semantic conventions, organizational process, and tooling work. I have spoken on OpenTelemetry at several conferences including 6 different KubeCons in both Europe and North America, OpenTelemetry Community Day, and Observe 20/20. In addition to speaking, I have immensely enjoyed connecting with other contributors and users at these events.

During my years on the GC I have helped evolve the project from an experimental tracing specification to an industry-standard observability API with thousands of contributors, hundreds of maintainers and approvers, and more than 10 stable implementations. Because of this experience, especially that of a long-time client implementation maintainer, and because of my long involvement with the GC, I am ideally suited to represent the needs of maintainers, approvers, and contributors.

I have always enjoyed my experience on the GC and, if re-elected, would continue to grow the community and the project to the best of my ability, with a focus on contributor experience, stability, and quality instrumentation.

Hi there! I‚Äôm Jamie Danielson, a dedicated contributor to OpenTelemetry since 2021, when I started working at Honeycomb. My passion for community building, technical leadership, and project management, combined with my background as a maintainer of the JavaScript SIG, make me a strong candidate for the GC role.

One of the main contributing factors for my [nomination to maintainer](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/pull/4824) was my ability to bring together folks and ideas from across the ecosystem and help prioritize work and drive things forward. One of the main factors that appeals to me about the [GC role](https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2024/otel-governance/) is the role I would play in project management. I have years of experience in managing projects and teams both in and out of tech. My background in accounting has helped hone my attention to detail, which is valuable when evaluating policies for a major project like OpenTelemetry.

I regularly speak at conferences like KubeCon + CloudNativeCon to advocate for OpenTelemetry, fostering greater adoption and engagement. I‚Äôm committed to building a collaborative, respectful, and inclusive open source community, where people feel welcome and empowered to contribute.

As a member of the GC, I would love to help set a steady pace of quality contributions, ensuring we continue to hit meaningful milestones and build a sustainable, future-proof project.

### Pablo Baeyens Fern√°ndez

![pablo-baeyens](static/pablo-baeyens.jpg)

- Company: [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/)
- GitHub: [mx-psi](https://github.com/mx-psi)

I am Pablo Baeyens (mx-psi), an OpenTelemetry maintainer and a contributor since 2020. You may know me from my work on the Collector SIG as a maintainer of core and contrib repositories, and my work on the System Semantic Conventions WG and the Contributor Experience SIG, which have made me one of the [top 10 contributors to the project](https://opentelemetry.devstats.cncf.io/d/9/developer-activity-counts-by-repository-group-table?orgId=1&var-period_name=Last%202%20years&var-metric=contributions&var-repogroup_name=All&var-country_name=All) in the last couple of years.

If elected, I want to focus on several areas, including: 

- Improving the contributor experience by recognizing and rewarding contributors, clearly defining how they can get to be a formal role (triagers, approvers, maintainers...) and ensuring our community grows in a healthy way 
- Ensuring maintainers have the tools they need to make the hard decisions, such as having decision processes that work and data about how users use OpenTelemetry in the wild  
- Enabling vendors, end user companies and other large organizations to contribute in a predictable way to OpenTelemetry with a better process to establish high-level 'project goals'    
- Continuing the journey of OpenTelemetry into an ecosystem, finding further avenues for collaboration with other projects, strengthening existing partnerships, and encouraging experimentation and new ideas.

Hi! I have been in the observability space for over a decade and have been a very active
OpenTelemetry community member since its early days.

Over the past two years, as a first-time Governance Committee member, some interests and contributions were:

- Responsiveness on community repo issues and project infrastructure needs
- Triaging specification issues with a product management hat
- Working toward stabilizing more components (HTTP semantic conventions, Database semantic conventions, Events)

I'm also a long-time maintainer of the OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation repository.

I really enjoy being part of the OpenTelemetry community and work hard to help others have a positive experience here.
I would love to continue my work on the Governance Committee over the next two years with your support.

Thanks :heart:
