# <<PROJECT NAME>>

## Background and description

Add any background that may be needed to introduce the scope of this project.

### Current challenges
List the current challenges that this project aims to solve. Focus on the problem here, how it affects users and what the downsides are if nothing is done, rather than the solution.

### Goals, objectives, and requirements
Describe the aim of this project, including the goals, objectives and requirements needed to solve the challenges presented in the previous section. Include here the motivations for starting the project now, as opposed to later. Call out the benefits for the OpenTelemetry project when this project is completed.

## Deliverables

A description of what this project is planning to deliver, or is in the process of delivering. This includes all OTEPs and their associated prototypes.

In general, OTEPs are not accepted unless they come with working prototypes available to review in at least two languages. Please discuss these requirements with a TC member before submitting an OTEP.

## Staffing / Help Wanted

Who is currently planning to work on the project? If a project requires specialized domain expertise, please list it here. If a project is missing a critical mass of people in order to begin work, please clarify.

### Required staffing

Projects cannot be started until the following participants have been identified:
* Every project needs a project lead, who is willing to bottom line the project and address any issues which are not handled by other project members.
* At least two sponsoring TC or GC members. Sponsors are dedicated to attending meetings, reviewing proposals, and in general being aware of the state of the project and its technical details. Sponsors guide the project through the spec process, keep the tracking issue up to date, and help to ensure that relevant community members provide input at the appropriate times.
* A GC liaison to facilitate this SIG's health and ensure project scope remains true to the project description. If a GC member is also a sponsor for this project, they are by default the GC liaison (see [GC check-ins](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/gc-check-ins.md)).
* Engineers willing to write prototypes in at least two languages (if relevant to project). Languages should be fairly different from each other (for example: Java and Python).
* Maintainers or approvers from those languages committed to reviewing the prototypes.

## Timeline

What is the expected timeline the project will aim to adhere to, and what resources and deliverables will be needed for each portion of the timeline? If the project has not been started, please describe this timeline in relative terms (one month in, two weeks later, etc). If a project has started, please include actual dates.

## Labels

Issues should be properly labeled to indicate what parts of the specification it is focused on. List here the labels applicable to this project.

## Project Board

Once approved, a project should be managed using a GitHub project board (see [open projects](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/projects?query=is%3Aopen)). This project board should be pre-populated with issues that cover all known deliverables, organized by timeline milestones.

Any [member](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/guides/contributor/membership.md) associated with the project can create the board. Once created, the creator of the board should:

- Assign `Admin` privileges on the project to the relevant project members (using a new or existing GitHub team).
- Change the visibility of the project to `Public` in order to share project status and priorities outside of the OpenTelemetry organization.
- Configure project workflows to automatically add issues and PRs to the board based on repositories and labels.

Once created, please add a link to the project board here.

## SIG Meetings and Other Info

Once a project is started, its corresponding SIG should meet regularly for discussion. These meeting times should be posted on the [OpenTelemetry public calendar](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#calendar) and automatically recorded.

Any relevant information related to the SIG (e.g. sponsors, meeting times, Slack channels, meeting notes, etc.) must be publicly available in the [community](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community) SIG tables, which can be updated via the [sigs.yml](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/sigs.yml) file and running `make table-generation`.

See [How to create and configure meetings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/docs/how-to-handle-public-calendar.md) for updating the public calendar or open an issue in the community repository so it's taken care of.
