# Project Tooling SIG

## Description

Currently, a variety of tools exist around OpenTelemetry for various
organizational purposes -- GitHub bots, for example, or the Stack Overflow to
Slack action. This SIG is being established to create sustaining engineering
efforts and best practices around these, and new, tools.

## Deliverables

- Document existing tools and their purpose, along with documentation and build
  instructions.
- Interview and collect feedback on cross-functional tooling needs (e.g., bots
  for GitHub issue management, IaC for organization management.)
- Institute best practices for tooling development and maintenance.
- Develop new tools as needed.
