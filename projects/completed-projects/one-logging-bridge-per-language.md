### Description

During the joint TC/GC call on Jan 11 2024, we agreed on a few items we'd like to accomplish this year. One such item was creating at least one logging bridge per Language SIG, so that our end-users can start using OTLP Logging natively in their applications.

We'll strive to get at least one logging bridge for each supported language. Language SIGs will be free to decide which bridge to implement based on the needs of their audiences.

### Project Board

To be created.

### Deliverables

For each one of the following languages, there should be at least one logging bridge available, either as part of their core repository or as part of their contrib repository. Usage of such bridge should be documented on opentelemetry.io's website.

Languages (100% of the languages available when this issue was created):

- One Logging Bridge per language - C++ [(#1900)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/1900)
- One Logging Bridge per language - .NET [(#1901)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/1901)
- One Logging Bridge per language - Erlang [(#1902)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/1902)
- One Logging Bridge per language - Go [(#1903)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/1903)
- One Logging Bridge per language - Java [(#1904)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/1904)
- One Logging Bridge per language - JavaScript [(#1905)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/1905)
- One Logging Bridge per language - PHP [(#1906)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/1906)
- One Logging Bridge per language - Python [(#1907)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/1907)
- One Logging Bridge per language - Ruby [(#1908)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/1908)
- One Logging Bridge per language - Rust [(#1909)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/1909)
- One Logging Bridge per language - Swift [(#1910)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/1910)

### Staffing / Help Wanted

We anticipate that Language SIG maintainers will share the vision that having at least one bridge, hopefully for the most used logging API for the language, is important for the SIG, and therefore, we don't anticipate new staffing requirements. However, we'll try to recruit new contributors to work on this once we have a few examples to follow.

#### Required staffing

@jpkrohling is the sponsor for this project and will work with the individual Language SIGs to implement this.

### Meeting Times

We'll use the regular Language SIGs meetings, as well as the maintainer's meeting on Monday.

### Timeline

We aim to complete this project by the end of 2024.
