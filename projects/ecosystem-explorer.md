# OpenTelemetry Ecosystem Explorer

## Background and description

Related issues:

* [Java Instrumentation Metadata System](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/issues/13468)
  * [Associated Github Project](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/projects/153?query=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aopen)
* [Java Instrumentation Documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/issues/7740)
* [Registry Data Quality Improvements Project Proposal](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/pull/2246)
* [Expose Collector component metadata in registry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/issues/4921)

This project is initially primarily focused on Java instrumentation, but the concepts and tooling could be applied to
other languages (and the collector) as well, and we intend to explore that.

As a user, contributor, or maintainer of official [Java OpenTelemetry instrumentations](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation),
I want documentation that can answer the following questions:

* What technologies and libraries are instrumented by the agent or have standalone instrumentation libraries I can use?
* Which versions of the various libraries or technologies are supported?
* How do I install and use the standalone instrumentation libraries?
* The library I use is supported, what kind of spans and metrics will be emitted when I use it?
* What attributes will the spans and metrics have?
* Are there any configurations I can enable to get additional or different attributes on my metrics or spans?
* Are there any configurations I can enable to get more/less metrics or spans for the libraries I use?
* I’m about to upgrade my Java agent from version x to version y, what telemetry or attributes changed?

A proof of concept "[Instrumentation Explorer](https://jaydeluca.github.io/instrumentation-explorer/)" website was 
created that can do all of this. It allows users to explore the different instrumentations and see the emitted telemetry.
It allows them to see how spans, metrics, and their associated attributes change when different configuration options are
changed, and it allows for comparing the telemetry across different versions of the Java agent.

This POC was created as part of an [effort](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/issues/13468)
by the Java SIG, which focused on analyzing the 250+ instrumentations in the Java agent, and created structured metadata
for each that could then be used to generate documentation.

We would like to rebuild and make this POC production-ready, and make it an official part of the OpenTelemetry 
documentation. We will create a standalone website that can be hosted on the OpenTelemetry domain, and integrate it into
the official OpenTelemetry documentation. We will also work to replicate this approach for collector components, and
the Javascript instrumentation.

### Current challenges with instrumentation documentation

The instrumentation projects are large code bases with many different components, often with behavior that changes 
depending on certain versions of the libraries in use in your code base, or if certain configuration options are enabled.

There are varying degrees of existing documentation for different instrumentation components, but it can be difficult to
find, and might not have all the information needed to understand the whole picture. Much of this documentation
exists on as github readmes, which are not indexed by google, and therefore are not easily discoverable.

Things can also change between different versions of the instrumentation artifacts themselves, and the resulting 
emitted telemetry can vary greatly. It can be frustrating for users to upgrade their OpenTelemetry instrumentation and
have their dashboards and alerts break because it’s not clear that signals or attributes were going to change.

In most cases, in order to understand what telemetry a user will get, they must first deploy their service using the 
instrumentation, find a way to execute all the different code paths, and then explore the resulting telemetry in a
backend. This is a lot of effort for someone who might be evaluating OpenTelemetry for the first time, and might deter
them from going through the exercise all together.

Maintainers of instrumentations also have the challenge of finding ways to keep the documentation up to date, and 
often have to make updates in several places. Most projects do a great job of keeping things up to date in the 
source code, but there isn't an existing process for ensuring that documentation is kept in sync.

The OpenTelemetry.io website has rich content related to SDKs, APIs, and concepts, but there is a gap when it comes to
instrumentation. The [registry](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/registry/) has some information, but it can be
lacking important context and there are many instrumentations that are not listed there at all. There have been
several discussions about improving or replacing the registry, and this project could be a good opportunity to do so.

### Project Scope and Architecture

This project encompasses multiple distinct layers, each with different stakeholders and responsibilities:

1. Metadata Format Definition
- Purpose: Define standardized schemas and formats for describing instrumentation components
- Current State:
  - Collector has existing metadata formats
  - Java instrumentation metadata schemas are being defined
  - Additional formats will be needed for other languages and components
- Stakeholders: OpenTelemetry SIGs (by & for SIG use)
- Approach: Use what exists, define what we need, collaborate with SIGs as they define their own
2. Metadata Creation
- Purpose: Generate actual metadata files that conform to the defined formats
- Current State:
  - Collector generates its own metadata
  - Java instrumentation metadata generation is in progress
  - Weaver may handle some generation tasks
- Stakeholders: OpenTelemetry SIGs and third-party contributors (e.g., custom collector components, external instrumentation libraries)
- Approach: Enable SIGs and third parties to generate metadata for their components

3. Metadata Collection & Centralization
- Purpose: Aggregate all metadata into a unified, automatically-maintained source of truth
- Components:
  - Collector metadata syncing mechanisms
  - Website automation (existing)
  - New registry infrastructure with automated freshness guarantees
- Stakeholders: Primary consumers are this project (explorer, registry), but third parties (Backstage, etc.) can consume it as well
- Approach: Build a new centralized registry that automatically keeps data current

4. Visualization & User Experience
- Purpose: Provide user-friendly interfaces for exploring and understanding the ecosystem
- Components: The Ecosystem Explorer web application (and potentially Registry 2.0)
- Stakeholders: End users, contributors evaluating instrumentation options
- Approach: Build the explorer as one representation; encourage others to build alternative visualizations

Project Focus: This project primarily focuses on layers 3 and 4 (collection/centralization and visualization),
while working closely with SIGs on layers 1 and 2 (format definition and metadata creation) to ensure all aspects of 
the ecosystem can be represented.

### Goals, objectives, and requirements

The aim of this project is to create an Ecosystem Explorer web application that provides a user interface to
explore instrumentation components across the OpenTelemetry ecosystem. The platform will be powered by structured
metadata and documentation extracted directly from instrumentation project source code, maintained through automated
processes.

**Primary Objectives:**

1. Address instrumentation documentation gaps by creating a centralized platform where users can:
    - Discover what technologies and libraries are instrumented
    - Understand what telemetry will be emitted (spans, metrics, attributes)
    - Compare telemetry across different versions and configurations
    - Access current documentation that addresses the scattered information problem identified in the "challenges" 
      section above

2. Establish a reusable documentation model that other language SIGs can adopt for their instrumentation projects,
  starting with Java and expanding to Javascript and Collector components

3. Integrate with the existing OpenTelemetry.io documentation ecosystem in a seamless manner

4. Implement automated maintenance workflows that keep documentation synchronized with source code changes

5. Replace the need for the existing [registry](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/registry/), which covers only a subset of
  the available information and is not comprehensive

**Technical Requirements:**

- Production-ready web application rebuilt from the existing proof-of-concept
- Automated extraction of structured metadata from instrumentation source code
- Scalable data architecture for storing and serving metadata
- Extraction and availability of metadata for Javascript and Collector components, to validate multi-language 
  applicability
