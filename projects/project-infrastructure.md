# Project Infrastructure SIG

## Description

As OpenTelemetry grows, the need for tooling and automation around project
infrastructure grows with it. This SIG is being established to create sustaining
engineering efforts and best practices around both existing, and new, tools.

Currently, a wide variety of tooling exists, including --

- Slack bots such as `stack-overflow-to-slack`.
- GitHub tooling for issue management.
- Automation for Zoom recording management.

Meanwhile, new tools are being requested to address problems such as --

- Membership and group management
- Repository adherence to best practices
- Automated updates for cross-cutting release concerns (e.g., creating issues in
  repositories for new spec or semconv releases)
- Package and release management
- Easier access to GitHub integrations for SIGs
- Improved visibility into project health

This SIG will be responsible for these cross-cutting concerns, and work to
build services that aid in maintainer, contributor, and community experience.

## Deliverables

- Document existing tools and their purpose, along with documentation and build
  instructions.
- Interview and collect feedback on cross-functional tooling needs (e.g., bots
  for GitHub issue management, IaC for organization management.)
- Institute best practices for tooling development and maintenance.
- Develop new tools as needed.
- Establish 'tooling-as-a-service' for SIGs.

The overall goal of this SIG is to remove the burden on the TC or organization
owners from administrative and tooling concerns, and to provide consistent,
well-documented, and useful tools for maintainers and contributors.
