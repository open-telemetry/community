# OpenTelemetry Configuration

## Description

OpenTelemetry specifies code that can operate in a variety of ways based on the end-userâ€™s desired mode of operation. This requires a configuration interface be provided to the user so they are able to communicate this information. Currently, OpenTelemetry specifies this interface in the form of environment variables. This environment variable interface is limited in the structure of information it can communicate and the primitives it can support.

The configuration project intends to produce the specification around the data model for language-agnostic configuration that provides additional flexibility for the end users.

## Project Board

https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/projects/38

## Deliverables

1. An OTEP
2. Prototypes in Java, Python, Go, Erlang
3. The specification of the configuration data model
4. A repository containing the schema and schema validation tooling

## Staffing / Help Wanted

End users of OpenTelemetry to help validate the usage and configuration scenarios would be great to have participate in the discussions.
