# LLM Observability Semantic Conventions

## Description

This project aims to establish observability standards for Large Language Model (LLM) applications, focusing on API interactions and multi-step LLM frameworks. Key areas include:

- Developing semantic conventions for standard and complex LLM interactions.
- Initiating vendor-specific conventions as a foundation for broader contributions.
- Concentrating on attributes relevant to Metrics and Spans.

For Spans: Instrumentation and debugging guidance for multi-step LLM applications, with recommendations on user privacy and intellectual property security, marking sensitive attributes and events as opt-in.

For Metrics: Tracking model performance by collecting and correlating data like model names, versions, parameters, latency, and evaluation scores.

## Deliverables

- Experimental semantic conventions for LLMs, allowing flexibility for evolution in this fast-paced field.
- Reference prototypes demonstrating the application of these conventions in data collection, processing, and analysis.
- Guidelines for monitoring LLM applications, including implementation strategies and privacy/security considerations.

## Staffing / Help Wanted

We will gather further staff as the project is established. We need to 
make sure there is enough representation across both vendors and customers
who will benefit from these semantic conventions.
