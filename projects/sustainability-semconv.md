## Description

This working group looks to identify and standardize observability for
sustainability purposes with regards to infrastructure and applications. This
would look at current tooling around sustainability metrics and standardize the
meaning and approach for these metrics.

Current efforts of implementations:

- [Kepler](https://github.com/sustainable-computing-io/kepler)
- [Scaphandre](https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre)

We want to have a unified conventions in order to better facilitate measuring sustainability metrics across different ecosystems.
