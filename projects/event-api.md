### Description

The Client / RUM Sig is looking to finalize, complete and resolve the outstanding issues / PR's that exist around the Event API / SDK and the Semantic Conventions that defines what an "event" is.

### Project Board

Project Board: https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/projects/65

### Deliverables

Resolve the outstanding Event Issues / PR's which will define

* Refine / stabilize event data model describing what an event is, the semantic meaning of event fields, and how they are sent over the network.
* Pave the way for defining event semantic conventions, allowing their schemas to be described in YAML and incorporated into build-tools.
* Define select event semantic conventions, establishing patterns for future event semantic conventions to follow.
* Refine / stabilize event API and any associated features in the SDK.

#### Required staffing

* Need: more domain experts willing to define the OTel Event standard
* Need: engineers willing to write prototypes in at least one more language other than JavaScript. Language should be fairly different from JavaScript.
* Need: maintainers or approvers from those languages committed to reviewing the prototypes.
