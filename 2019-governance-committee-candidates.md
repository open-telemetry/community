### Constance Caramanolis

- Company: Splunk / Omnition
- GitHub: [ccaraman](https://github.com/ccaraman)

I am Senior Software engineer at Omnition, now Splunk, contributing to
OpenTelemetry and increasing adoption through tech talks. In 2020, I will be a
Kubecon Co-Chair. Prior to Omnition, I was at Lyft for 3 years maintaining,
operating and evangelizing Envoy. I presented over ten talks, including Kubecon
2018 Keynote, on utilizing and leveraging Envoy which led to close partnerships
with diverse engineers. Through my involvement in OpenTelemetry, I've
collaborated with companies to solve their various telemetry problems. This is
similar to what I did with Envoy. This consistent dialogue and interaction with
the community is what made it so strong. I want to bring the same philosophies
to OpenTelemetry and grow the community and project into the one we've all
invested so much in building.

I'm currently the Head of SRE at Zalando and have been working with
approximately 200 engineering teams increasing the observability and reliability
of the Zalando e-Commerce platform. Zalando is an enthusiastic adopter of many
CNCF technologies namely Kubernetes and OpenTracing. Zalando has been leveraging
tracing in new ways, namely improving the on-call health of the so-called
micro-service organizations
(<https://srecon19emea.sched.com/event/ScjD/are-we-all-on-the-same-page-lets-fix-that>).
I am personally very interested in contributing some time and effort to make
OpenTelemetry a success, not only for Zalando but for the many other similar
organizations out there.

### Steven Le Roux

![Steven Le Roux photo](static/steven-le-roux.jpg)

- Company: OVHcloud
- GitHub: [StevenLeRoux](https://github.com/StevenLeRoux)

I work on the Time Series landscape since a while. My first contribution was an
intent for a exposition format from 2013
<https://github.com/StevenLeRoux/TimeSeries_Format_Specification>. I've directly
and indirectly worked on the Warp10 TSDB
<https://github.com/senx/warp10-platform/> and been in charge of observability
at OVH (a major european cloud provider) with few public contributions:

- blog post : <https://www.ovh.com/blog/monitoring-guidelines-for-ovh-observability/>
- <https://github.com/ovh/noderig>
- <https://github.com/ovh/beamium>

I think this journey can be resumed in these slides:
<https://fr.slideshare.net/StevenLeRoux1/metrics-spark-meetup>.  Lately we've
created TSL (Time Series Language) that we think could be the SQL for Time
Series (metrics, logs and tracing) and we would love to contribute it.
<https://github.com/ovh/tsl>.

OVH is a Cloud provider and my nomination would serve both the community for
useful and quality tools and APIs, and also I would represent the cloud provider
which aims to expose its products metrics in a standard exposition format to
ease adoption (Currently our product metrics are available via
Graphite/OpenTSDB/Warp10/Influx and PromQL APIs).

### Ted Young

- Company: LightStep
- GitHub: [tedsuo](https://github.com/tedsuo)

Iâ€™ve been part of the OpenTracing leadership team for the past 2.5 years. My
primary focus has been on API design, technical project management, and
facilitation. In fact, facilitating the merger of OpenCensus and OpenTracing is
one of my proudest accomplishments! I would like to join the OpenTelemetry
governance committee, as the position aligns well with the role that I currently
perform for the OpenTelemetry community.
