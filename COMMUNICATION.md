# Communication within the OpenTelemetry Project

## Document purpose

OpenTelemetry has a [Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
which primarily pertains to "bannable" offenses: things like harassment,
personal attacks, and so on. Certainly OpenTelemetry does not tolerate any such
behavior.

And while we all deserve to collaborate without fear of overt harassment and
personal attacks, that is a very low bar! This document is more aspirational and
has fewer "teeth" (i.e., it's not about "banning" people), but it's also very
important: it describes **how we wish to communicate with each other** and **how
we aspire to create an environment that cultivates trust**, even in the face of
inevitable technical and organizational disagreement.

Finally, this is **a living document** and should be adapted over time as the
OpenTelemetry project evolves. At any time, there are certainly errors of
omissions or even simple clarifications we can make to the wording here, and any
and all are welcome to propose such changes.

Now, without further ado:

## Communication guidelines

What follows are an unordered list of principles that guide our communication
with each other – both active community members as well as those who may just be
"passing through" to file an issue or suggest an improvement.

* **Critique ideas, not people:** It's fine and expected to disagree about
  technology and project direction. Even when those disagreements are
  significant or frustrating, though, it isn't acceptable to criticize the
  participants as people. In fact, it's usually a sign that there's no strong
  technical argument being made. (More specifically, see [this
  post](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/07/08/10-tips-for-reviewing-code-you-dont-like/)
  for tips about code reviews in particular)
* **Be welcoming:** By nature, OpenTelemetry touches a lot of other projects and
  will thus have a larger-than-normal ratio of casual committers and passers-by.
  For this reason, it's especially important to be welcoming to newcomers. This
  means thanking them for their interest and contributions, and being patient
  with their initial misunderstandings. In fact, their points of confusion are a
  valuable signal pointing towards documentation gaps.
* **Try to keep conversations in the open:** Where possible, try to have
  conversations in async formats like GitHub issues, PRs, and emails. If
  resolution requires a call or videoconference, try to make a recording and
  notes available and discoverable to keep our community as accessible as
  possible across distant timezones.
* **Strive for consensus, but don't require it:** Of course it's great when we
  can get everyone to agree. And certainly everyone should be – and should feel
  – heard. As a rule of thumb, if there is a lone dissenter (or three) in any
  given discussion, their points should be clearly addressed: not just with a
  simplistic "Sorry, I disagree," but with a principled counterargument.
  Finally, our formal process for escalation and decision-making is a matter of
  policy, not just a matter of communication; as such, it is out of scope for
  this document.

_Additional guidelines, edits, or other improvements to the above are always
welcome._
